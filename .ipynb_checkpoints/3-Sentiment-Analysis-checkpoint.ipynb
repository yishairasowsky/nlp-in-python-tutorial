    "So far, all of the analysis we've done has been pretty generic - looking at counts, creating scatter plots, etc. These techniques could be applied to numeric data as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to text data, there are a few popular techniques that we'll be going through in the next few notebooks, starting with sentiment analysis. A few key points to remember with sentiment analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **TextBlob Module:** Linguistic researchers have labeled the sentiment of words based on their domain expertise. Sentiment of words can vary based on where it is in a sentence. The TextBlob module allows us to take advantage of these labels.\n",
    "2. **Sentiment Labels:** Each word in a corpus is labeled in terms of polarity and subjectivity (there are more labels as well, but we're going to ignore them for now). A corpus' sentiment is the average of these.\n",
    "   * **Polarity**: How positive or negative a word is. -1 is very negative. +1 is very positive.\n",
    "   * **Subjectivity**: How subjective, or opinionated a word is. 0 is fact. +1 is very much an opinion.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more info on how TextBlob coded up its [sentiment function](https://planspace.org/20150607-textblob_sentiment/).\n",

the children of benjamin was abidan the son of gideoni and the standard of the camp of the children of dan which was the rearward of all the camps set forward according to their hosts and over his host was ahiezer the son of ammishaddai and over the host of the tribe of the children of asher was pagiel the son of ochran and over the host of the tribe of the children of naphtali was ahira the son of enan thus were the journeyings of the children of israel according to their hostsand they set forward s and moses said unto hobab the son of reuel the midianite moses fatherinlaw we are journeying unto the place of which the lord said i will give it you come thou with us and we will do thee good for the lord hath spoken good concerning israel and he said unto him i will not go but i will depart to mine own land and to my kindred and he said leave us not i pray thee forasmuch as thou knowest how we are to encamp in the wilderness and thou shalt be to us instead of eyes and it shall be if thou go with us yea it shall be that what good soever the lord shall do unto us the same will we do unto thee and they set forward from the mount of the lord three days journey and the ark of the covenant of the lord went before them three days journey to seek out a restingplace for them and the cloud of the lord was over them by day when they set forward from the camp s and it came to pass when the ark set forward that moses said rise up o lord and let thine enemies be scattered and let them that hate thee flee before thee and when it rested he said return o lord unto the ten thousands of the families of israel  and the people were as murmurers speaking evil in the ears of the lord and when the lord heard it his anger was kindled and the fire of the lord burnt among them and devoured in the uttermost part of the camp and the people cried unto moses and moses prayed unto the lord and the fire abated and the name of that place was called taberah because the fire of the lord burnt among them and the mixed multitude that was among them fell a lusting and the children of israel also wept on their part and said would that we were given flesh to eat we remember the fish which we were wont to eat in egypt for nought the cucumbers and the melons and the leeks and the onions and the garlic but now our soul is dried away there is nothing at all we have nought save this manna to look to now the manna was like coriander seed and the appearance thereof as the appearance of bdellium the people went about and gathered it and ground it in mills or beat it in mortars and seethed it in pots and made cakes of it and the taste of it was as the taste of a cake baked with oil and when the dew fell upon the camp in the night the manna fell upon it and moses heard the people weeping family by family every man at the door of his tent and the anger of the lord was kindled greatly and moses was displeased and moses said unto the lord wherefore hast thou dealt ill with thy servant and wherefore have i not found favour in thy sight that thou layest the burden of all this people upon me have i conceived all this people have i brought them forth that thou shouldest say unto me carry them in thy bosom as a nursingfather carrieth the sucking child unto the land which thou didst swear unto their fathers whence should i have flesh to give unto all this people for they trouble me with their weeping saying give us flesh that we may eat i am not able to bear all this people myself alone because it is too heavy for me and if thou deal thus with me kill me i pray thee out of hand if i have found favour in thy sight and let me not look upon my wretchedness  and the lord said unto moses gather unto me seventy men of the elders of israel whom thou knowest to be the elders of the people and officers over them and bring them unto the tent of meeting that they may stand there with thee and i will come down and speak with thee there and i will take of the spirit which is upon thee and will put it upon them and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee that thou bear it not thyself alone and say thou unto the people sanctify yourselves against tomorrow and ye shall eat flesh for ye have wept in the ears of the lord saying would that we were given flesh to eat for it was well with us in egypt therefore the lord will give you flesh and ye shall eat ye shall not eat one day nor two days nor five days neither ten days nor twenty days but a whole month until it come out at your nostrils and it be loathsome unto you because that ye have rejected the lord who is among you and have troubled him with weeping saying why now came we forth out of egypt and moses said the people among whom i am are six hundred thousand men on foot and yet thou hast said i will give them flesh that they may eat a whole month if flocks and herds be slain for them will they suffice them or if all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them will they suffice them  and the lord said unto moses is the lords hand waxed short now shalt thou see whether my word shall come to pass unto thee or not and moses went out and told the people the words of the lord and he gathered seventy men of the elders of the people and set them round about the tent and the lord came down in the cloud and spoke unto him and took of the spirit that was upon him and put it upon the seventy elders and it came to pass that when the spirit rested upon them they prophesied but they did so no more but there remained two men in the camp the name of the one was eldad and the name of the o',\n",
       "  'ther medad and the spirit rested upon them and they were of them that were recorded but had not gone out unto the tent and they prophesied in the camp and there ran a young man and told moses and said eldad and medad are prophesying in the camp and joshua the son of nun the minister of moses from his youth up answered and said my lord moses shut them in and moses said unto him art thou jealous for my sake would that all the lords people were prophets that the lord would put his spirit upon them and moses withdrew into the camp he and the elders of israel and there went forth a wind from the lord and brought across quails from the sea and let them fall by the camp about a days journey on this side and a days journey on the other side round about the camp and about two cubits above the face of the earth and the people rose up all that day and all the night and all the next day and gathered the quails he that gathered least gathered ten heaps and they spread them all abroad for themselves round about the camp while the flesh was yet between their teeth ere it was chewed the anger of the lord was kindled against the people and the lord smote the people with a very great plague and the name of that place was called kibrothhattaavah because there they buried the people that lusted from kibrothhattaavah the people journeyed unto hazeroth and they abode at hazeroth  and miriam and aaron spoke against moses because of the cushite woman whom he had married for he had married a cushite woman and they said hath the lord indeed spoken only with moses hath he not spoken also with us and the lord heard it now the man moses was very meek above all the men that were upon the face of the earth s and the lord spoke suddenly unto moses and unto aaron and unto miriam come out ye three unto the tent of meeting and they three came out and the lord came down in a pillar of cloud and stood at the door of the tent and called aaron and miriam and they both came forth and he said hear now my words if there be a prophet among you i the lord do make myself known unto him in a vision i do speak with him in a dream my servant moses is not so he is trusted in all my house with him do i speak mouth to mouth even manifestly and not in dark speeches and the similitude of the lord doth he behold wherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant against moses and the anger of the lord was kindled against them and he departed and when the cloud was removed from over the tent behold miriam was leprous as white as snow and aaron looked upon miriam and behold she was leprous and aaron said unto moses oh my lord lay not i pray thee sin upon us for that we have done foolishly and for that we have sinned let her not i pray be as one dead of whom the flesh is half consumed when he cometh out of his mothers womb and moses cried unto the lord saying heal her now o god i beseech thee  and the lord said unto moses if her father had but spit in her face should she not hide in shame seven days let her be shut up without the camp seven days and after that she shall be brought in again and miriam was shut up without the camp seven days and the people journeyed not till miriam was brought in again and afterward the people journeyed from hazeroth and pitched in the wilderness of paran  and the lord spoke unto moses saying send thou men that they may spy out the land of canaan which i give unto the children of israel of every tribe of their fathers shall ye send a man every one a prince among them and moses sent them from the wilderness of paran according to the commandment of the lord all of them men who were heads of the children of israel and these were their names of the tribe of reuben shammua the son of zaccur of the tribe of simeon shaphat the son of hori of the tribe of judah caleb the son of jephunneh of the tribe of issachar igal the son of joseph of the tribe of ephraim hoshea the son of nun of the tribe of benjamin palti the son of raphu of the tribe of zebulun gaddiel the son of sodi of the tribe of joseph namely of the tribe of manasseh gaddi the son of susi of the tribe of dan ammiel the son of gemalli of the tribe of asher sethur the son of michael of the tribe of naphtali nahbi the son of vophsi of the tribe of gad geuel the son of machi these are the names of the men that moses sent to spy out the land and moses called hoshea the son of nun joshua and moses sent them to spy out the land of canaan and said unto them get you up here into the south and go up into the mountains and see the land what it is and the people that dwelleth therein whether they are strong or weak whether they are few or many and what the land is that they dwell in whether it is good or bad and what cities they are that they dwell in whether in camps or in strongholds and what the land is whether it is fat or lean whether there is wood therein or not and be ye of good courage and bring of the fruit of the landnow the time was the time of the firstripe grapes so they went up and spied out the land from the wilderness of zin unto rehob at the entrance to hamath and they went up into the south and came unto hebron and ahiman sheshai and talmai the children of anak were therenow hebron was built seven years before zoan in egypt and they came unto the valley of eshcol and cut down from thence a branch with one cluster of grapes and they bore it upon a pole between two they took also of the pomegranates and of the figs that place was called the valley of eshcol because of the cluster which the children of israel cut down from thence and they returned from spying out the land at the end of forty days and they went and came to moses and to aaron and to all the congregation of the children of israel unto the wilderness of paran to kadesh and brought back word unto them and unto all the congregation and showed them the fruit of the land and they told him and said we came unto the land whither thou sentest us and surely it floweth with milk and honey and this is the fruit of it howbeit the people that dwell in the land are fierce and the cities are fortified and very great and moreover we saw the children of anak there amalek dwelleth in the land of the south and the hittite and the jebusite and the amorite dwell in the mountains and the canaanite dwelleth by the sea and along by the side of the jordan and caleb stilled the people toward moses and said we should go up at once and possess it for we are well able to overcome it but the men that went up with him said we are not able to go up against the people for they are stronger than we and they spread an evil report of the land which they had spied out unto the children of israel saying the land through which we have passed to spy it out is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof and all the people that we saw in it are men of great stature and there we saw the nephilim the sons of anak who come of the nephilim and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers and so we were in their sight and all the congregation lifted up their voice and cried and the people wept that night and all the children of israel murmured against moses and against aaron and the whole congregation said unto them would that we had died in the land of egypt or would we had died in this wilderness and wherefore doth the lord bring us unto this land to fall by the sword our wives and our little ones will be a prey were it not better for us to return into egypt and they said one to another let us make a captain and let us return into egypt then moses and aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of israel and joshua the son of nun and caleb the son of jephunneh who were of them that spied out the land rent their clothes and they spoke unto all the congregation of the children of israel saying the land which we passed through to spy it out is an exceeding good land if the lord delight in us then he will bring us into this land and give it unto usa land which floweth with milk and honey only rebel not against the lord neither fear ye the people of the land for they are bread for us their defence is removed from over them and the lord is with us fear them not but all the congregation bade stone them with stones when the glory of the lord appeared in the tent of meeting unto all the children of israel  and the lord said unto moses how long will this people despise me and how long will they not believe in me for all the signs which i have wrought among t',\n",
       "  'hem i will smite them with the pestilence and destroy them and will make of thee a nation greater and mightier than they and moses said unto the lord when the egyptians shall hearfor thou broughtest up this people in thy might from among them they will say to the inhabitants of this land who have heard that thou lord art in the midst of this people inasmuch as thou lord art seen face to face and thy cloud standeth over them and thou goest before them in a pillar of cloud by day and in a pillar of fire by night now if thou shalt kill this people as one man then the nations which have heard the fame of thee will speak saying because the lord was not able to bring this people into the land which he swore unto them therefore he hath slain them in the wilderness and now i pray thee let the power of the lord be great according as thou hast spoken saying the lord is slow to anger and plenteous in lovingkindness forgiving iniquity and transgression and that will by no means clear the guilty visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children upon the third and upon the fourth generation pardon i pray thee the iniquity of this people according unto the greatness of thy lovingkindness and according as thou hast forgiven this people from egypt even until now and the lord said i have pardoned according to thy word but in very deed as i liveand all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the lord surely all those men that have seen my glory and my signs which i wrought in egypt and in the wilderness yet have put me to proof these ten times and have not hearkened to my voice surely they shall not see the land which i swore unto their fathers neither shall any of them that despised me see it but my servant caleb because he had another spirit with him and hath followed me fully him will i bring into the land whereinto he went and his seed shall possess it now the amalekite and the canaanite dwell in the vale tomorrow turn ye and get you into the wilderness by the way to the red sea  and the lord spoke unto moses and unto aaron saying how long shall i bear with this evil congregation that keep murmuring against me i have heard the murmurings of the children of israel which they keep murmuring against me say unto them as i live saith the lord surely as ye have spoken in mine ears so will i do to you your carcasses shall fall in this wilderness and all that were numbered of you according to your whole number from twenty years old and upward ye that have murmured against me surely ye shall not come into the land concerning which i lifted up my hand that i would make you dwell therein save caleb the son of jephunneh and joshua the son of nun but your little ones that ye said would be a prey them will i bring in and they shall know the land which ye have rejected but as for you your carcasses shall fall in this wilderness and your children shall be wanderers in the wilderness forty years and shall bear your strayings until your carcasses be consumed in the wilderness after the number of the days in which ye spied out the land even forty days for every day a year shall ye bear your iniquities even forty years and ye shall know my displeasure i the lord have spoken surely this will i do unto all this evil congregation that are gathered together against me in this wilderness they shall be consumed and there they shall die and the men whom moses sent to spy out the land and who when they returned made all the congregation to murmur against him by bringing up an evil report against the land even those men that did bring up an evil report of the land died by the plague before the lord but joshua the son of nun and caleb the son of jephunneh remained alive of those men that went to spy out the land and moses told these words unto all the children of israel and the people mourned greatly and they rose up early in the morning and got them up to the top of the mountain saying lo we are here and will go up unto the place which the lord hath promised for we have sinned and moses said wherefore now do ye transgress the commandment of the lord seeing it shall not prosper go not up for the lord is not among you that ye be not smitten down before your enemies for there the amalekite and the canaanite are before you and ye shall fall by the sword forasmuch as ye are turned back from following the lord and the lord will not be with you but they presumed to go up to the top of the mountain nevertheless the ark of the covenant of the lord and moses departed not out of the camp then the amalekite and the canaanite who dwelt in that hillcountry came down and smote them and beat them down even unto hormah  and the lord spoke unto moses saying speak unto the children of israel and say unto them when ye are come into the land of your habitations which i give unto you and will make an offering by fire unto the lord a burntoffering or a sacrifice in fulfilment of a vow clearly uttered or as a freewilloffering or in your appointed seasons to make a sweet savour unto the lord of the herd or of the flock then shall he that bringeth his offering present unto the lord a mealoffering of a tenth part of an ephah of fine flour mingled with the fourth part of a hin of oil and wine for the drinkoffering the fourth part of a hin shalt thou prepare with the burntoffering or for the sacrifice for each lamb or for a ram thou shalt prepare for a mealoffering two tenth parts of an ephah of fine flour mingled with the third part of a hin of oil and for the drinkoffering thou shalt present the third part of a hin of wine of a sweet savour unto the lord and when thou preparest a bullock for a burntoffering or for a sacrifice in fulfilment of a vow clearly uttered or for peaceofferings unto the lord then shall there be presented with the bullock a mealoffering of three tenth parts of an ephah of fine flour mingled with half a hin of oil and thou shalt present for the drinkoffering half a hin of wine for an offering made by fire of a sweet savour unto the lord thus shall it be done for each bullock or for each ram or for each of the helambs or of the kids according to the number that ye may prepare so shall ye do for every one according to their number all that are homeborn shall do these things after this manner in presenting an offering made by fire of a sweet savour unto the lord and if a stranger sojourn with you or whosoever may be among you throughout your generations and will offer an offering made by fire of a sweet savour unto the lord as ye do so he shall do as for the congregation there shall be one statute both for you and for the stranger that sojourneth with you a statute for ever throughout your generations as ye are so shall the stranger be before the lord one law and one ordinance shall be both for you and for the stranger that sojourneth with you  and the lord spoke unto moses saying speak unto the children of israel and say unto them when ye come into the land whither i bring you then it shall be that when ye eat of the bread of the land ye shall set apart a portion for a gift unto the lord of the first of your dough ye shall set apart a cake for a gift as that which is set apart of the threshingfloor so shall ye set it apart of the first of your dough ye shall give unto the lord a portion for a gift throughout your generations s and when ye shall err and not observe all these commandments which the lord hath spoken unto moses even all that the lord hath commanded you by the hand of moses from the day that the lord gave commandment and onward throughout your generations then it shall be if it be done in error by the congregation it being hid from their eyes that all the congregation shall offer one young bullock for a burntoffering for a sweet savour unto the lordwith the mealoffering thereof and the drinkoffering thereof according to the ordinanceand one hegoat for a sinoffering and the priest shall make atonement for all the congregation of the children of israel and they shall be forgiven for it was an error and they have brought their offering an offering made by fire unto the lord and their sinoffering before the lord for their error and all the congregation of the children of israel shall be forgiven and the stranger that sojourneth among them for in respect of all the people it was done in error s and if one person sin through error then he shall offer a shegoat of the first year for a sinoffering and the priest shall make atonement for the soul that erreth when he sinneth through erro',\n",
       "  'r before the lord to make atonement for him and he shall be forgiven both he that is homeborn among the children of israel and the stranger that sojourneth among them ye shall have one law for him that doeth aught in error but the soul that doeth aught with a high hand whether he be homeborn or a stranger the same blasphemeth the lord and that soul shall be cut off from among his people because he hath despised the word of the lord and hath broken his commandment that soul shall utterly be cut off his iniquity shall be upon him  and while the children of israel were in the wilderness they found a man gathering sticks upon the sabbath day and they that found him gathering sticks brought him unto moses and aaron and unto all the congregation and they put him in ward because it had not been declared what should be done to him s and the lord said unto moses the man shall surely be put to death all the congregation shall stone him with stones without the camp and all the congregation brought him without the camp and stoned him with stones and he died as the lord commanded moses  and the lord spoke unto moses saying speak unto the children of israel and bid them that they make them throughout their generations fringes in the corners of their garments and that they put with the fringe of each corner a thread of blue and it shall be unto you for a fringe that ye may look upon it and remember all the commandments of the lord and do them and that ye go not about after your own heart and your own eyes after which ye use to go astray that ye may remember and do all my commandments and be holy unto your god i am the lord your god who brought you out of the land of egypt to be your god i am the lord your god  now korah the son of izhar the son of kohath the son of levi with dathan and abiram the sons of eliab and on the son of peleth sons of reuben took men and they rose up in face of moses with certain of the children of israel two hundred and fifty men they were princes of the congregation the elect men of the assembly men of renown and they assembled themselves together against moses and against aaron and said unto them ye take too much upon you seeing all the congregation are holy every one of them and the lord is among them wherefore then lift ye up yourselves above the assembly of the lord and when moses heard it he fell upon his face and he spoke unto korah and unto all his company saying in the morning the lord will show who are his and who is holy and will cause him to come near unto him even him whom he may choose will he cause to come near unto him this do take you censors korah and all his company and put fire therein and put incense upon them before the lord tomorrow and it shall be that the man whom the lord doth choose he shall be holy ye take too much upon you ye sons of levi and moses said unto korah hear now ye sons of levi is it but a small thing unto you that the god of israel hath separated you from the congregation of israel to bring you near to himself to do the service of the tabernacle of the lord and to stand before the congregation to minister unto them and that he hath brought thee near and all thy brethren the sons of levi with thee and will ye seek the priesthood also therefore thou and all thy company that are gathered together against the lord and as to aaron what is he that ye murmur against him and moses sent to call dathan and abiram the sons of eliab and they said we will not come up is it a small thing that thou hast brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey to kill us in the wilderness but thou must needs make thyself also a prince over us moreover thou hast not brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey nor given us inheritance of fields and vineyards wilt thou put out the eyes of these men we will not come up and moses was very wroth and said unto the lord respect not thou their offering i have not taken one ass from them neither have i hurt one of them and moses said unto korah be thou and all thy congregation before the lord thou and they and aaron tomorrow and take ye every man his firepan and put incense upon them and bring ye before the lord every man his firepan two hundred and fifty firepans thou also and aaron each his firepan and they took every man his firepan and put fire in them and laid incense thereon and stood at the door of the tent of meeting with moses and aaron and korah assembled all the congregation against them unto the door of the tent of meeting and the glory of the lord appeared unto all the congregation s and the lord spoke unto moses and unto aaron saying separate yourselves from among this congregation that i may consume them in a moment and they fell upon their faces and said o god the god of the spirits of all flesh shall one man sin and wilt thou be wroth with all the congregation s and the lord spoke unto moses saying speak unto the congregation saying get you up from about the dwelling of korah dathan and abiram and moses rose up and went unto dathan and abiram and the elders of israel followed him and he spoke unto the congregation saying depart i pray you from the tents of these wicked men and touch nothing of theirs lest ye be swept away in all their sins so they got them up from the dwelling of korah dathan and abiram on every side and dathan and abiram came out and stood at the door of their tents with their wives and their sons and their little ones and moses said hereby ye shall know that the lord hath sent me to do all these works and that i have not done them of mine own mind if these men die the common death of all men and be visited after the visitation of all men then the lord hath not sent me but if the lord make a new thing and the ground open her mouth and swallow them up with all that appertain unto them and they go down alive into the pit then ye shall understand that these men have despised the lord and it came to pass as he made an end of speaking all these words that the ground did cleave asunder that was under them and the earth opened her mouth and swallowed them up and their households and all the men that appertained unto korah and all their goods so they and all that appertained to them went down alive into the pit and the earth closed upon them and they perished from among the assembly and all israel that were round about them fled at the cry of them for they said lest the earth swallow us up and fire came forth from the lord and devoured the two hundred and fifty men that offered the incense s and the lord spoke unto moses saying speak unto eleazar the son of aaron the priest that he take up the firepans out of the burning and scatter thou the fire yonder for they are become holy even the firepans of these men who have sinned at the cost of their lives and let them be made beaten plates for a covering of the altarfor they are become holy because they were offered before the lordthat they may be a sign unto the children of israel and eleazar the priest took the brazen firepans which they that were burnt had offered and they beat them out for a covering of the altar to be a memorial unto the children of israel to the end that no common man that is not of the seed of aaron draw near to burn incense before the lord that he fare not as korah and as his company as the lord spoke unto him by the hand of moses  but on the morrow all the congregation of the children of israel murmured against moses and against aaron saying ye have killed the people of the lord and it came to pass when the congregation was assembled against moses and against aaron that they looked toward the tent of meeting and behold the cloud covered it and the glory of the lord appeared and moses and aaron came to the front of the tent of meeting s and the lord spoke unto moses saying get you up from among this congregation that i may consume them in a moment and they fell upon their faces and moses said unto aaron take thy firepan and put fire therein from off the altar and lay incense thereon and carry it quickly unto the congregation and make atonement for them for there is wrath gone out from the lord the plague is begun and aaron took as moses spoke and ran into the midst of the assembly and behold the plague was begun among the people and he put on the incense and made atonement for the people and he stood between the dead and the living and the plague was stayed now they that died by the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred besides them that died about the matter of',\n",
       "  ' korah and aaron returned unto moses unto the door of the tent of meeting and the plague was stayed  and the lord spoke unto moses saying speak unto the children of israel and take of them rods one for each fathers house of all their princes according to their fathers houses twelve rods thou shalt write every mans name upon his rod and thou shalt write aarons name upon the rod of levi for there shall be one rod for the head of their fathers houses and thou shalt lay them up in the tent of meeting before the testimony where i meet with you and it shall come to pass that the man whom i shall choose his rod shall bud and i will make to cease from me the murmurings of the children of israel which they murmur against you and moses spoke unto the children of israel and all their princes gave him rods for each prince one according to their fathers houses even twelve rods and the rod of aaron was among their rods and moses laid up the rods before the lord in the tent of the testimony and it came to pass on the morrow that moses went into the tent of the testimony and behold the rod of aaron for the house of levi was budded and put forth buds and bloomed blossoms and bore ripe almonds and moses brought out all the rods from before the lord unto all the children of israel and they looked and took every man his rod  and the lord said unto moses put back the rod of aaron before the testimony to be kept there for a token against the rebellious children that there may be made an end of their murmurings against me that they die not thus did moses as the lord commanded him so did he  and the children of israel spoke unto moses saying behold we perish we are undone we are all undone every one that cometh near that cometh near unto the tabernacle of the lord is to die shall we wholly perish s and the lord said unto aaron thou and thy sons and thy fathers house with thee shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary and thou and thy sons with thee shall bear the iniquity of your priesthood and thy brethren also the tribe of levi the tribe of thy father bring thou near with thee that they may be joined unto thee and minister unto thee thou and thy sons with thee being before the tent of the testimony and they shall keep thy charge and the charge of all the tent only they shall not come nigh unto the holy furniture and unto the altar that they die not neither they nor ye and they shall be joined unto thee and keep the charge of the tent of meeting whatsoever the service of the tent may be but a common man shall not draw nigh unto you and ye shall keep the charge of the holy things and the charge of the altar that there be wrath no more upon the children of israel and i behold i have taken your brethren the levites from among the children of israel for you they are given as a gift unto the lord to do the service of the tent of meeting and thou and thy sons with thee shall keep your priesthood in everything that pertaineth to the altar and to that within the veil and ye shall serve i give you the priesthood as a service of gift and the common man that draweth nigh shall be put to death  and the lord spoke unto aaron and i behold i have given thee the charge of my heaveofferings even of all the hallowed things of the children of israel unto thee have i given them for a consecrated portion and to thy sons as a due for ever this shall be thine of the most holy things reserved from the fire every offering of theirs even every mealoffering of theirs and every sinoffering of theirs and every guiltoffering of theirs which they may render

i given thee and thy sons and thy daughters with thee as a due for ever it is an everlasting covenant of salt before the lord unto thee and to thy seed with thee and the lord said unto aaron thou shalt have no inheritance in their land neither shalt thou have any portion among them i am thy portion and thine inheritance among the children of israel s and unto the children of levi behold i have given all the tithe in israel for an inheritance in return for their service which they serve even the service of the tent of meeting and henceforth the children of israel shall not come nigh the tent of meeting lest they bear sin and die but the levites alone shall do the service of the tent of meeting and they shall bear their iniquity it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations and among the children of israel they shall have no inheritance for the tithe of the children of israel which they set apart as a gift unto the lord i have given to the levites for an inheritance therefore i have said unto them among the children of israel they shall have no inheritance  and the lord spoke unto moses saying moreover thou shalt speak unto the levites and say unto them when ye take of the children of israel the tithe which i have given you from them for your inheritance then ye shall set apart of it a gift for the lord even a tithe of the tithe and the gift which ye set apart shall be reckoned unto you as though it were the corn of the threshingfloor and as the fulness of the winepress thus ye also shall set apart a gift unto the lord of all your tithes which ye receive of the children of israel and thereof ye shall give the gift which is set apart unto the lord to aaron the priest out of all that is given you ye shall set apart all of that which is due unto the lord of all the best thereof even the hallowed part thereof out of it therefore thou shalt say unto them when ye set apart the best thereof from it then it shall be counted unto the levites as the increase of the threshingfloor and as the increase of the winepress and ye may eat it in every place ye and your households for it is your reward in return for your service in the tent of meeting and ye shall bear no sin by reason of it seeing that ye have set apart from it the best thereof and ye shall not profane the holy things of the children of israel that ye die not  and the lord spoke unto moses and unto aaron saying this is the statute of the law which the lord hath commanded saying speak unto the children of israel that they bring thee a red heifer faultless wherein is no blemish and upon which never came yoke and ye shall give her unto eleazar the priest and she shall be brought forth without the camp and she shall be slain before his face and eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger and sprinkle of her blood toward the front of the tent of meeting seven times and the heifer shall be burnt in his sight her skin and her flesh and her blood with her dung shall be burnt and the priest shall take cedarwood and hyssop and scarlet and cast it into the midst of the burning of the heifer then the priest shall wash his clothes and he shall bathe his flesh in water and afterward he may come into the camp and the priest shall be unclean until the even and he that burneth her shall wash his clothes in water and bathe his fl',\n",
       "  'esh in water and shall be unclean until the even and a man that is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer and lay them up without the camp in a clean place and it shall be kept for the congregation of the children of israel for a water of sprinkling it is a purification from sin and he that gathereth the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes and be unclean until the even and it shall be unto the children of israel and unto the stranger that sojourneth among them for a statute for ever he that toucheth the dead even any mans dead body shall be unclean seven days the same shall purify himself therewith on the third day and on the seventh day and he shall be clean but if he purify not himself the third day and the seventh day he shall not be clean whosoever toucheth the dead even the body of any man that is dead and purifieth not himselfhe hath defiled the tabernacle of the lordthat soul shall be cut off from israel because the water of sprinkling was not dashed against him he shall be unclean his uncleanness is yet upon him this is the law when a man dieth in a tent every one that cometh into the tent and every thing that is in the tent shall be unclean seven days and every open vessel which hath no covering closebound upon it is unclean and whosoever in the open field toucheth one that is slain with a sword or one that dieth of himself or a bone of a man or a grave shall be unclean seven days and for the unclean they shall take of the ashes of the burning of the purification from sin and running water shall be put thereto in a vessel and a clean person shall take hyssop and dip it in the water and sprinkle it upon the tent and upon all the vessels and upon the persons that were there and upon him that touched the bone or the slain or the dead or the grave and the clean person shall sprinkle upon the unclean on the third day and on the seventh day and on the seventh day he shall purify him and he shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and shall be clean at even but the man that shall be unclean and shall not purify himself that soul shall be cut off from the midst of the assembly because he hath defiled the sanctuary of the lord the water of sprinkling hath not been dashed against him he is unclean and it shall be a perpetual statute unto them and he that sprinkleth the water of sprinkling shall wash his clothes and he that toucheth the water of sprinkling shall be unclean until even and whatsoever the unclean person toucheth shall be unclean and the soul that toucheth him shall be unclean until even  and the children of israel even the whole congregation came into the wilderness of zin in the first month and the people abode in kadesh and miriam died there and was buried there and there was no water for the congregation and they assembled themselves together against moses and against aaron and the people strove with moses and spoke saying would that we had perished when our brethren perished before the lord and why have ye brought the assembly of the lord into this wilderness to die there we and our cattle and wherefore have ye made us to come up out of egypt to bring us in unto this evil place it is no place of seed or of figs or of vines or of pomegranates neither is there any water to drink and moses and aaron went from the presence of the assembly unto the door of the tent of meeting and fell upon their faces and the glory of the lord appeared unto them  and the lord spoke unto moses saying take the rod and assemble the congregation thou and aaron thy brother and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes that it give forth its water and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock so thou shalt give the congregation and their cattle drink and moses took the rod from before the lord as he commanded him and moses and aaron gathered the assembly together before the rock and he said unto them hear now ye rebels are we to bring you forth water out of this rock and moses lifted up his hand and smote the rock with his rod twice and water came forth abundantly and the congregation drank and their cattle s and the lord said unto moses and aaron because ye believed not in me to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of israel therefore ye shall not bring this assembly into the land which i have given them these are the waters of meribah where the children of israel strove with the lord and he was sanctified in them s and moses sent messengers from kadesh unto the king of edom thus saith thy brother israel thou knowest all the travail that hath befallen us how our fathers went down into egypt and we dwelt in egypt a long time and the egyptians dealt ill with us and our fathers and when we cried unto the lord he heard our voice and sent an angel and brought us forth out of egypt and behold we are in kadesh a city in the uttermost of thy border let us pass i pray thee through thy land we will not pass through field or through vineyard neither will we drink of the water of the wells we will go along the kings highway we will not turn aside to the right hand nor to the left until we have passed thy border and edom said unto him thou shalt not pass through me lest i come out with the sword against thee and the children of israel said unto him we will go up by the highway and if we drink of thy water i and my cattle then will i give the price thereof let me only pass through on my feet there is no hurt and he said thou shalt not pass through and edom came out against him with much people and with a strong hand thus edom refused to give israel passage through his border wherefore israel turned away from him  and they journeyed from kadesh and the children of israel even the whole congregation came unto mount hor and the lord spoke unto moses and aaron in mount hor by the border of the land of edom saying aaron shall be gathered unto his people for he shall not enter into the land which i have given unto the children of israel because ye rebelled against my word at the waters of meribah take aaron and eleazar his son and bring them up unto mount hor and strip aaron of his garments and put them upon eleazar his son and aaron shall be gathered unto his people and shall die there and moses did as the lord commanded and they went up into mount hor in the sight of all the congregation and moses stripped aaron of his garments and put them upon eleazar his son and aaron died there in the top of the mount and moses and eleazar came down from the mount and when all the congregation saw that aaron was dead they wept for aaron thirty days even all the house of israel s and the canaanite the king of arad who dwelt in the south heard tell that israel came by the way of atharim and he fought against israel and took some of them captive and israel vowed a vow unto the lord and said if thou wilt indeed deliver this people into my hand then i will utterly destroy their cities and the lord hearkened to the voice of israel and delivered up the canaanites and they utterly destroyed them and their cities and the name of the place was called hormah  and they journeyed from mount hor by the way to the red sea to compass the land of edom and the soul of the people became impatient because of the way and the people spoke against god and against moses wherefore have ye brought us up out of egypt to die in the wilderness for there is no bread and there is no water and our soul loatheth this light bread and the lord sent fiery serpents among the people and they bit the people and much people of israel died and the people came to moses and said we have sinned because we have spoken against the lord and against thee pray unto the lord that he take away the serpents from us and moses prayed for the people and the lord said unto moses make thee a fiery serpent and set it upon a pole and it shall come to pass that every one that is bitten when he seeth it shall live and moses made a serpent of brass and set it upon the pole and it came to pass that if a serpent had bitten any man when he looked unto the serpent of brass he lived and the children of israel journeyed and pitched in oboth and they journeyed from oboth and pitched at ijeabarim in the wilderness which is in front of moab toward the sunrising from thence they journeyed and pitched in the valley of zered from thence they journeyed and pitched on the other side of the arnon which is in the wilderness that cometh out of the border of the amoritesfor arnon is the border of moab between moab and the amorites wh',\n",
       "  'erefore it is said in the book of the wars of the lord vaheb in suphah and the valleys of arnon and the slope of the valleys that inclineth toward the seat of ar and leaneth upon the border of moab and from thence to beer that is the well whereof the lord said unto moses gather the people together and i will give them water s then sang israel this song spring up o wellsing ye unto it the well which the princes digged which the nobles of the people delved with the sceptre and with their staves and from the wilderness to mattanah and from mattanah to nahaliel and from nahaliel to bamoth and from bamoth to the valley that is in the field of moab by the top of pisgah which looketh down upon the desert  and israel sent messengers unto sihon king of the amorites saying let me pass through thy land we will not turn aside into field or into vineyard we will not drink of the water of the wells we will go by the kings highway until we have passed thy border and sihon would not suffer israel to pass through his border but sihon gathered all his people together and went out against israel into the wilderness and came to jahaz and he fought against israel and israel smote him with the edge of the sword and possessed his land from the arnon unto the jabbok even unto the children of ammon for the border of the children of ammon was strong and israel took all these cities and israel dwelt in all the cities of the amorites in heshbon and in all the towns thereof for heshbon was the city of sihon the king of the amorites who had fought against the former king of moab and taken all his land out of his hand even unto the arnon wherefore they that speak in parables say come ye to heshbon let the city of sihon be built and established for a fire is gone out of heshbon a flame from the city of sihon it hath devoured ar of moab the lords of the high places of arnon woe to thee moab thou art undone o people of chemosh he hath given his sons as fugitives and his daughters into captivity unto sihon king of the amorites we have shot at themheshbon is perishedeven unto dibon and we have laid waste even unto nophah which reacheth unto medeba thus israel dwelt in the land of the amorites and moses sent to spy out jazer and they took the towns thereof and drove out the amorites that were there and they turned and went up by the way of bashan and og the king of bashan went out against them he and all his people to battle at edrei and the lord said unto moses fear him not for i have delivered him into thy hand and all his people and his land and thou shalt do to him as thou didst unto sihon king of the amorites who dwelt at heshbon so they smote him and his sons and all his people until there was none left him remaining and they possessed his land and the children of israel journeyed and pitched in the plains of moab beyond the jordan at jericho s and balak the son of zippor saw all that israel had done to the amorites and moab was sore afraid of the people because they were many and moab was overcome with dread because of the children of israel and moab said unto the elders of midian now will this multitude lick up all that is round about us as the ox licketh up the grass of the fieldand balak the son of zippor was king of moab at that time and he sent messengers unto balaam the son of beor to pethor which is by the river to the land of the children of his people to call him saying behold there is a people come out from egypt behold they cover the face of the earth and they abide over against me come now therefore i pray thee curse me this people for they are too mighty for me peradventure i shall prevail that we may smite them and that i may drive them out of the land for i know that he whom thou blessest is blessed and he whom thou cursest is cursed and the elders of moab and the elders of midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand and they came unto balaam and spoke unto him the words of balak and he said unto them lodge here this night and i will bring you back word as the lord may speak unto me and the princes of moab abode with balaam and god came unto balaam and said what men are these with thee and balaam said unto god balak the son of zippor king of moab hath sent unto me  behold the people that is come out of egypt it covereth the face of the earth now come curse me them peradventure i shall be able to fight against them and shall drive them out and god said unto balaam thou shalt not go with them thou shalt not curse the people for they are blessed and balaam rose up in the morning and said unto the princes of balak get you into your land for the lord refuseth to give me leave to go with you and the princes of moab rose up and they went unto balak and said balaam refuseth to come with us and balak sent yet again princes more and more honourable than they and they came to balaam and said to him thus saith balak the son of zippor let nothing i pray thee hinder thee from coming unto me for i will promote thee unto very great honour and whatsoever thou sayest unto me i will do come therefore i pray thee curse me this people and balaam answered and said unto the servants of balak if balak would give me his house full of silver and gold i cannot go beyond the word of the lord my god to do any thing small or great now therefore i pray you tarry ye also here this night that i may know what the lord will speak unto me more and god came unto balaam at night and said unto him if the men are come to call thee rise up go with them but only the word which i speak unto thee that shalt thou do and balaam rose up in the morning and saddled his ass and went with the princes of moab and gods anger was kindled because he went and the angel of the lord placed himself in the way for an adversary against himnow he was riding upon his ass and his two servants were with him and the ass saw the angel of the lord standing in the way with his sword drawn in his hand and the ass turned aside out of the way and went into the field and balaam smote the ass to turn her into the way then the angel of the lord stood in a hollow way between the vineyards a fence being on this side and a fence on that side and the ass saw the angel of the lord and she thrust herself unto the wall and crushed balaams foot against the wall and he smote her again and the angel of the lord went further and stood in a narrow place where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left and the ass saw the angel of the lord and she lay down under balaam and balaams anger was kindled and he smote the ass with his staff and the lord opened the mouth of the ass and she said unto balaam what have i done unto thee that thou hast smitten me these three times and balaam said unto the ass because thou hast mocked me i would there were a sword in my hand for now i had killed thee and the ass said unto balaam am not i thine ass upon which thou hast ridden all thy life long unto this day was i ever wont to do so unto thee and he said nay then the lord opened the eyes of balaam and he saw the angel of the lord standing in the way with his sword drawn in his hand and he bowed his head and fell on his face and the angel of the lord said unto him wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass these three times behold i am come forth for an adversary because thy way is contrary unto me and the ass saw me and turned aside before me these three times unless she had turned aside from me surely now i had even slain thee and saved her alive and balaam said unto the angel of the lord i have sinned for i knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me now therefore if it displease thee i will get me back and the angel of the lord said unto balaam go with the men but only the word that i shall speak unto thee that thou shalt speak so balaam went with the princes of balak and when balak heard that balaam was come he went out to meet him unto irmoab which is on the border of arnon which is in the utmost part of the border and balak said unto balaam did i not earnestly send unto thee to call thee wherefore camest thou not unto me am i not able indeed to promote thee to honour and balaam said unto balak lo i am come unto thee have i now any power at all to speak any thing the word that god putteth in my mouth that shall i speak and balaam went with balak and they came unto kiriathhuzoth and balak sacrificed oxen and sheep and sent to balaam and to the princes that were with him and it came to pass in the morning that balak took balaam a',\n",
       "  'nd brought him up into bamothbaal and he saw from thence the utmost part of the people and balaam said unto balak build me here seven altars and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams and balak did as balaam had spoken and balak and balaam offered on every altar a bullock and a ram and balaam said unto balak stand by thy burntoffering and i will go peradventure the lord will come to meet me and whatsoever he showeth me i will tell thee and he went to a bare height and god met balaam and he said unto him i have prepared the seven altars and i have offered up a bullock and a ram on every altar and the lord put a word in balaams mouth and said return unto balak and thus thou shalt speak and he returned unto him and lo he stood by his burntoffering he and all the princes of moab and he took up his parable and said from aram balak bringeth me the king of moab from the mountains of the east come curse me jacob and come execrate israel how shall i curse whom god hath not cursed and how shall i execrate whom the lord hath not execrated for from the top of the rocks i see him and from the hills i behold him lo it is a people that shall dwell alone and shall not be reckoned among the nations who hath counted the dust of jacob or numbered the stock of israel let me die the death of the righteous and let mine end be like his and balak said unto balaam what hast thou done unto me i took thee to curse mine enemies and behold thou hast blessed them altogether and he answered and said must i not take heed to speak that which the lord putteth in my mouth and balak said unto him come i pray thee with me unto another place from whence thou mayest see them thou shalt see but the utmost part of them and shalt not see them all and curse me them from thence and he took him into the field of zophim to the top of pisgah and built seven altars and offered up a bullock and a ram on every altar and he said unto balak stand here by thy burntoffering while i go toward a meeting yonder and the lord met balaam and put a word in his mouth and said return unto balak and thus shalt thou speak and he came to him and lo he stood by his burntoffering and the princes of moab with him and balak said unto him what hath the lord spoken and he took up his parable and said arise balak and hear give ear unto me thou son of zippor god is not a man that he should lie neither the son of man that he should repent when he hath said will he not do it or when he hath spoken will he not make it good behold i am bidden to bless and when he hath blessed i cannot call it back none hath beheld iniquity in jacob neither hath one seen perverseness in israel the lord his god is with him and the shouting for the king is among them god who brought them forth out of egypt is for them like the lofty horns of the wildox for there is no enchantment with jacob neither is there any divination with israel now is it said of jacob and of israel what hath god wrought behold a people that riseth up as a lioness and as a lion doth he lift himself up he shall not lie down until he eat of the prey and drink the blood of the slain and balak said unto balaam neither curse them at all nor bless them at all but balaam answered and said unto balak told not i thee saying all that the lord speaketh that i must do and balak said unto balaam come now i will take thee unto another place peradventure it will please god that thou mayest curse me them from thence and balak took balaam unto the top of peor that looketh down upon the desert and balaam said unto balak build me here seven altars and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams and balak did as balaam had said and offered up a bullock and a ram on every altar and when balaam saw that it pleased the lord to bless israel he went not as at the other times to meet with enchantments but he set his face toward the wilderness and balaam lifted up his eyes and he saw israel dwelling tribe by tribe and the spirit of god came upon him and he took up his parable and said the saying of balaam the son of beor and the saying of the man whose eye is opened the saying of him who heareth the words of god who seeth the vision of the almighty fallen down yet with opened eyes how goodly are thy tents o jacob thy dwellings o israel as valleys stretched out as gardens by the riverside as aloes planted of the lord as cedars beside the waters water shall flow from his branches and his seed shall be in many waters and his king shall be higher than agag and his kingdom shall be exalted god who brought him forth out of egypt is for him like the lofty horns of the wildox he shall eat up the nations that are his adversaries and shall break their bones in pieces and pierce them through with his arrows he couched he lay down as a lion and as a lioness who shall rouse him up blessed be every one that blesseth thee and cursed be every one that curseth thee and balaks anger was kindled against balaam and he smote his hands together and balak said unto balaam i called thee to curse mine enemies and behold thou hast altogether blessed them these three times therefore now flee thou to thy place i thought to promote thee unto great honour but lo the lord hath kept thee back from honour and balaam said unto balak spoke i not also to thy messengers that thou didst send unto me saying if balak would give me his house full of silver and gold i cannot go beyond the word of the lord to do either good or bad of mine own mind what the lord speaketh that will i speak and now behold i go unto my people come and i will announce to thee what this people shall do to thy people in the end of days and he took up his parable and said the saying of balaam the son of beor and the saying of the man whose eye is opened the saying of him who heareth the words of god and knoweth the knowledge of the most high who seeth the vision of the almighty fallen down yet with opened eyes i see him but not now i behold him but not nigh there shall step forth a star out of jacob and a scepter shall rise out of israel and shall smite through the corners of moab and break down all the sons of seth and edom shall be a possession seir also even his enemies shall be a possession while israel doeth valiantly and out of jacob shall one have dominion and shall destroy the remnant from the city and he looked on amalek and took up his parable and said amalek was the first of the nations but his end shall come to destruction and he looked on the kenite and took up his parable and said though firm be thy dwellingplace and though thy nest be set in the rock nevertheless kain shall be wasted how long asshur shall carry thee away captive and he took up his parable and said alas who shall live after god hath appointed him but ships shall come from the coast of kittim and they shall afflict asshur and shall afflict eber and he also shall come to destruction and balaam rose up and went and returned to his place and balak also went his way  and israel abode in shittim and the people began to commit harlotry with the daughters of moab and they called the people unto the sacrifices of their gods and the people did eat and bowed down to their gods and israel joined himself unto the baal of peor and the anger of the lord was kindled against israel and the lord said unto moses take all the chiefs of the people and hang them up unto the lord in face of the sun that the fierce anger of the lord may turn away from israel and moses said unto the judges of israel slay ye every one his men that have joined themselves unto the baal of peor and behold one of the children of israel came and brought unto his brethren a midianitish woman in the sight of moses and in the sight of all the congregation of the children of israel while they were weeping at the door of the tent of meeting and when phinehas the son of eleazar the son of aaron the priest saw it he rose up from the midst of the congregation and took a spear in his hand and he went after the man of israel into the chamber and thrust both of them through the man of israel and the woman through her belly so the plague was stayed from the children of israel and those that died by the plague were twenty and four thousand  and the lord spoke unto moses saying phinehas the son of eleazar the son of aaron the priest hath turned my wrath away from the children of israel in that he was very jealous for my sake among them so that i consumed not the children of israel in my jealousy wherefore say behold i give unto him my cov',\n",
       "  'enant of peace and it shall be unto him and to his seed after him the covenant of an everlasting priesthood because he was jealous for his god and made atonement for the children of israel now the name of the man of israel that was slain who was slain with the midianitish woman was zimri the son of salu a prince of a fathers house among the simeonites and the name of the midianitish woman that was slain was cozbi the daughter of zur he was head of the people of a fathers house in midian  and the lord spoke unto moses saying harass the midianites and smite them for they harass you by their wiles wherewith they have beguiled you in the matter of peor and in the matter of cozbi the daughter of the prince of midian their sister who was slain on the day of the plague in the matter of peor and it came to pass after the plague p\\xa0that the lord spoke unto moses and unto eleazar the son of aaron the priest saying take the sum of all the congregation of the children of israel from twenty years old and upward by their fathers houses all that are able to go forth to war in israel and moses and eleazar the priest spoke with them in the plains of moab by the jordan at jericho

commanded moses between a man and his wife between a father and his daughter being in her youth in her fathers house  and the lord spoke unto moses saying avenge the children of israel of the midianites afterward shalt thou be gathered unto thy people and moses spoke unto the people saying arm ye men from among you for the war that they may go against midian to execute the lords vengeance on midian of every tribe a thousand throughout all the tribes of israel shall ye send to the war so there were delivered out of the thousands of israel a thousand of every tribe twelve thousand armed

the jordan at jericho s and moses and eleazar the priest and all the princes of the congregation went forth to meet them without the camp and moses was wroth with the officers of the host the captains of thousands and the captains of hundreds who came from the service of the war and moses said unto them have ye saved all the women alive behold these caused the children of israel through the counsel of balaam to revolt so as to break faith with the lord in the matter of peor and so the plague was among the congregation of the lord now therefore kill every male among the little ones and ki',\n",

commanded moses howbeit the gold and the silver the brass the iron the tin and the lead every thing that may abide the fire ye shall make to go through the fire and it shall be clean nevertheless it shall be purified with the water of sprinkling and all that abideth not the fire ye shall make to go through the water and ye shall wash your clothes on the seventh day and ye shall be clean and

houses of the congregation and divide the prey into two parts between the men skilled in war that went out to battle and all the congregation and levy a tribute unto the lord of the men of war that went out to battle one soul of five hundred both of the persons and of the beeves and of the asses and of the flocks take it of their half and give it unto eleazar the priest as a portion set apart for the lord and of the children of israels half thou shalt take one drawn out of every fifty of the persons of the beeves of the asses and of the flocks even of all the cattle and give them unto the levites that keep the charge of the tabernacle of the lord and moses and eleazar the priest did as the lord commanded moses now the prey over and above the booty which the men of war took was six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and five thousand sheep and threescore and twelve thousand beeves and threescore and one thousand asses and thirty and two thousand persons in all of the women that had not known man by lying with him and the half which was the portion of them that went out to war was in number three hundred thousand and thirty thousand and seven thousand and five hundred sheep and the lords tribute of the sheep was six hundred and threescore and fifteen and the beeves were thirty and six thousand of which the lords tribute was threescore and twelve and the asses were thirty thousand and five hundred of which the lords tribute was threescore and one and the persons were sixteen thousand of whom the lords tribute was thirty and two persons and moses gave the tribute which was set apart for the lord unto eleazar the priest as the lord commanded moses and of the children of israels half which moses divided off from the men that warred now the congregations half was three hundred thousand and thirty thousand and seven thousand and five hundred sheep and thirty and six thousand beeves and thirty thousand and five hundred asses and sixteen thousand persons even of the children of israels half moses took one drawn out of every fifty both of man and of beast and gave them unto the levites that kept the charge of the tabernacle of the lord as the lord commanded moses and the officers that were over the thousands of the host the captains of thousands and the captains of hundreds came near unto moses and they said unto moses thy servants have taken the sum of the men of war that are under our charge and there lacketh not one man of us and we have brought the lords offering what every man hath gotten of jewels of gold armlets and bracelets signetrings earrings and girdles to make atonement for our souls before the lord and moses and eleazar the priest took the gold of them even all wrought jewels and all the gold of the gift that they set apart for the lord of the captains of thousands and of the captains of hundreds was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels for the men of war had taken booty every man for himself and moses and eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains of thousands and of hundreds and brought it into the tent of meeting for a memorial for the children of israel before the lord  now the children of reuben and the children of gad had a very great multitude of cattle and when they saw the land of jazer and the land of gilead that behold the place was a place for cattle the children of gad and the children of reuben came and spoke unto moses and to eleazar the priest and unto the princes of the congregation saying ataroth and dibon and jazer and nimrah and heshbon and elealeh and sebam and nebo and beon the land which the lord smote before the congregation of israel is a land for cattle and thy servants have cattle s and they said if we have found favour in thy sight let this land be given unto thy servants for a possession bring us not over the jordan and moses said unto the children of gad and to the children of reuben shall your brethren go to the war and shall ye sit here and wherefore will ye turn away the heart of the children of israel from going over into the land which the lord hath given them thus did your fathers when i sent them from kadeshbarnea to see the land for when they went up unto the valley of eshcol and saw the land they turned away the heart of the children of israel that they should not go into the land which the lord had given them and the lords anger was kindled in that day and he swore saying surely none of the men that came up out of egypt from twenty years old and upward shall see the land which i swore unto abraham unto isaac and unto jacob because they have not wholly followed me save caleb the son of jephunneh the kenizzite and joshua the son of nun because they have wholly followed the lord and the lords anger was kindled against israel and he made them wander to and fro in the wilderness forty years until all the generation that had done evil in the sight of the lord was consumed and behold ye are risen up in your fathers stead a brood of sinful men to augment yet the fierce anger of the lord toward israel for if ye turn away from after him he will yet again leave them in the wilderness and so ye will destroy all this people s and they came near unto him and said we will build sheepfolds here for our cattle and cities for our little ones but we ourselves will be ready armed to go before the children of israel until we have brought them unto their place and our little ones shall dwell in the fortified cities because of the inhabitants of the land we will not return unto our houses until the children of israel have inherited every man his inheritance for we will not inherit with them on the other side of the jordan and forward because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side of the jordan eastward  and moses said unto them if ye will do this thing if ye will arm yourselves to go before the lord to the war and every armed man of you will pass over the jordan before the lord until he hath driven out his enemies from before him and the land be subdued before the lord and ye return afterward then ye shall be clear before the lord and before israel and this land shall be unto you for a possession before the lord but if ye will not do so behold ye have sinned against the lord and know ye your sin which will find you build you cities for your little ones and folds for your sheep and do that which hath proceeded out of your mouth and the children of gad and the children of reuben spoke unto moses saying thy servants will do as my lord commandeth our little ones our wives our flocks and all our cattle shall be there in the cities of gilead but thy servants will pass over every man that is armed for war before the lord to battle as my lord saith so moses gave charge concerning them to eleazar the priest and to joshua the son of nun and to the heads of the fathers houses of the tribes of the children of israel and moses said unto them if the children of gad and the children of reuben will pass with you over the jordan every man that is armed to battle before the lord and the land shall be subdued before you then ye shall give them the land of gilead for a possession but if they will not pass over with you armed they shall have possessions among you in the land of canaan and the children of gad and the children of reuben answered saying as the lord hath ',\n",
       "  'said unto thy servants so will we do we will pass over armed before the lord into the land of canaan and the possession of our inheritance shall remain with us beyond the jordan and moses

which ye shall give unto the levites shall be from the wall of the city and outward a thousand cubits round about and ye shall measure without the city for the east side two thousand cubits and for the south side two thousand cubits and for the west side two thousand cubits and for the north side two thousand cubits the city being in the midst this shall be to them the open land about the cities

the cities which ye shall give to the levites shall be forty and eight cities them shall ye give with the open land about them and concerning the cities which ye shall give of the possession of the

lord spoke unto moses saying speak unto the children of israel and say unto them when ye pass over the jordan into the land of canaan then ye shall appoint you cities to be cities of refuge for you that the manslayer that killeth any person through error may flee thither and the cities shall be unto you for refuge from the avenger that the manslayer die not until he stand before the congregation for judgment and as to the cities which ye shall give there shall be for you six cities of refuge ye shall give three cities beyond the jordan and three cities shall ye give in the land of canaan they shall be cities of refuge for the children of israel and for the stranger and for the settler among them shall these six cities be for refuge that every one that killeth any person through error may flee thither but if he smote him with an instrument of iron so that he died he is a murderer the murderer shall surely be put to death and if he smote him with a stone in the hand whereby a man may die and he died he is a murderer the murderer shall surely be put to death or if he smote him with a weapon of wood in the hand whereby a man may die and he died he is a murderer the murderer shall surely be put to death the avenger of blood shall himself put the murderer to death when he meeteth him he shall put him to death and if he thrust him of hatred or hurled at him any thing lying in wait so that he died or in enmity smote him with his hand that he died he that smote him shall surely be put to death he is a murderer the avenger of blood shall put the murderer to death when he meeteth him but if he thrust him suddenly without enmity or hurled upon him any thing without lying in wait or with any stone whereby a man may die seeing him not and cast it upon him so that he died and he was not his enemy neither sought his harm then the congregation shall judge between the smiter and the avenger of blood according to these ordinances and the congregation shall deliver the manslayer out of the hand of the avenger of blood and the congregation shall restore him to his city of refuge whither he was fled and he shall dwell therein until the death of the high priest who was anointed with the holy oil but if the manslayer shall at any time go beyond the border of his city of refuge whither he fleeth and the avenger of blood find him without the border of his city of refuge and the avenger of blood slay the manslayer there shall be no bloodguiltiness for him because he must remain in his city of refuge until the death of the high priest but after the death of the high priest the manslayer may return into the land of his possession and these things shall be for a statute of judgment unto you throughout your generations in all your dwellings whoso killeth any person the murderer shall be slain at the mouth of witnesses but one witness shall not testify against any person that he die moreover ye shall take no ransom for the life of a murderer that is guilty of death but he shall surely be put to death and ye shall take no ransom for him that is fled to his city of refuge that he should come again to dwell in the land until the death of the priest so ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye are for blood it polluteth the land and no expiation can be made for the land for the blood that is shed therein but by the blood of him that shed it and thou

the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they shall belong so will it be taken away from the lot of our inheritance and when the jubilee of the children of israel shall be then will their inheritance be added unto the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they shall belong so will their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers and moses commanded the children of israel according to the word of the lord saying the tribe of the sons of joseph speaketh right this is the thing which the lord hath commanded concerning the daughters of zelophehad saying let them be married to whom they think best only into the family of the tribe of their father shall they be married so shall no inheritance of the children of israel remove from tribe to tribe for the children of israel shall cleave every one to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers and every daughter that possesseth an inheritance in any tribe of the children of israel shall be wife unto one of the family of the tribe of her father that the children of israel may possess every man the inheritance of his fathers so shall no inheritance remove from one tribe to another tribe for the tribes of the children of israel shall cleave each one to its own inheritance even as the lord commanded moses so did the daughters of zelophehad for mahlah tirzah and hoglah and milcah and noah the daughters of zelophehad were married unto their fathers brothers sons they were married into the families of the sons of manasseh the son of joseph and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of

       " [' now these are the names of the sons of israel who came into egypt with jacob every man came with his household reuben simeon levi and judah issachar zebulun and benjamin dan and naphtali gad and asher and all the souls that came out of the loins of jacob were seventy souls and joseph was in egypt already and joseph died and all his brethren and all that generation and the children of israel were fruitful and increased abundantly and multiplied and waxed exceeding mighty and the land was filled with them  now there arose a new king over egypt who knew not joseph and he said unto his people behold the people of the children of israel are too many and too mighty for us come let us deal wisely with them lest they multiply and it come to pass that when there befalleth us any war they also join themselves unto our enemies and fight against us and get them up out of the land therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens and they built for pharaoh storecities pithom and raamses but the more they afflicted them the more they multiplied and the more they spread abroad and they were adread because of the children of israel and the egyptians made the children of israel to serve with rigour and they made their lives bitter with hard service in mortar and in brick and in all manner of service in the field in all their service wherein they made them serve with rigour and the king of egypt spoke to the hebrew midwives of whom the name of the one was shiphrah and the name of the other puah and he said when ye do the office of a midwife to the hebrew women ye shall look upon the birthstool if it be a son then ye shall kill him but if it be a daughter then she shall live but the midwives feared god and did not as the king of egypt commanded them but saved the menchildren alive and the king of egypt called for the midwives and said unto them why have ye done this thing and have saved the menchildren alive and the midwives said unto pharaoh because the hebrew women are not as the egyptian women for they are lively and are delivered ere the midwife come unto them and god dealt well with the midwives and the people multiplied and waxed very mighty and it came to pass because the midwives feared god that he made them houses and pharaoh charged all his people saying every son that is born ye shall cast into the river and every daughter ye shall save alive  and there went a man of the house of levi and took to wife a daughter of levi and the woman conceived and bore a son and when she saw him that he was a goodly child she hid him three months and when she could not longer hide him she took for him an ark of bulrushes and daubed it with slime and with pitch and she put the child therein and laid it in the flags by the rivers brink and his sister stood afar off to know what would be done to him and the daughter of pharaoh came down to bathe in the river and her maidens walked along by the riverside and she saw the ark among the flags and sent her handmaid to fetch it and she opened it and saw it even the child and behold a boy that wept and she had compassion on him and said this is one of the hebrews children then said his sister to pharaohs daughter shall i go and call thee a nurse of the hebrew women that she may nurse the child for thee and pharaohs daughter said to her go and the maiden went and called the childs mother and pharaohs daughter said unto her take this child away and nurse it for me and i will give thee thy wages and the woman took the child and nursed it and the child grew and she brought him unto pharaohs daughter and he became her son and she called his name moses and said because i drew him out of the water and it came to pass in those days when moses was grown up that he went out unto his brethren and looked on their burdens and he saw an egyptian smiting a hebrew one of his brethren and he looked this way and that way and when he saw that there was no man he smote the egyptian and hid him in the sand and he went out the second day and behold two men of the hebrews were striving together and he said to him that did the wrong wherefore smitest thou thy fellow and he said who made thee a ruler and a judge over us thinkest thou to kill me as thou didst kill the egyptian and moses feared and said surely the thing is known now when pharaoh heard this thing he sought to slay moses but moses fled from the face of pharaoh and dwelt in the land of midian and he sat down by a well now the priest of midian had seven daughters and they came and drew water and filled the troughs to water their fathers flock and the shepherds came and drove them away but moses stood up and helped them and watered their flock and when they came to reuel their father he said how is it that ye are come so soon today and they said an egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds and moreover he drew water for us and watered the flock and he said unto his daughters and where is he why is it that ye have left the man call him that he may eat bread and moses was content to dwell with the man and he gave moses zipporah his daughter and she bore a son and he called his name gershom for he said i have been a stranger in a strange land  and it came to pass in the course of those many days that the king of egypt died and the children of israel sighed by reason of the bondage and they cried and their cry came up unto god by reason of the bondage and god heard their groaning and god remembered his covenant with abraham with isaac and with jacob and god saw the children of israel and god took cognizance of them s now moses was keeping the flock of jethro his fatherinlaw the priest of midian and he led the flock to the farthest end of the wilderness and came to the mountain of god unto horeb and the angel of the lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush and he looked and behold the bush burned with fire and the bush was not consumed and moses said i will turn aside now and see this great sight why the bush is not burnt and when the lord saw that he turned aside to see god called unto him out of the midst of the bush and said moses moses and he said here am i and he said draw not nigh hither put off thy shoes from off thy feet for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground moreover he said i am the god of thy father the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob and moses hid his face for he was afraid to look upon god and the lord said i have surely seen the affliction of my people that are in egypt and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters for i know their pains and i am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the egyptians and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large unto a land flowing with milk and honey unto the place of the canaanite and the hittite and the amorite and the perizzite and the hivite and the jebusite and now behold the cry of the children of israel is come unto me moreover i have seen the oppression wherewith the egyptians oppress them come now therefore and i will send thee unto pharaoh that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of israel out of egypt and moses said unto god who am i that i should go unto pharaoh and that i should bring forth the children of israel out of egypt and he said certainly i will be with thee and this shall be the token unto thee that i have sent thee when thou hast brought forth the people out of egypt ye shall serve god upon this mountain and moses said unto god behold when i come unto the children of israel and shall say unto them the god of your fathers hath sent me unto you and they shall say to me what is his name what shall i say unto them and god said unto moses i am that i am and he said thus shalt thou say unto the children of israel i am hath sent me unto you and god said moreover unto moses thus shalt thou say unto the children of israel the lord the god of your fathers the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob hath sent me unto you this is my name for ever and this is my memorial unto all generations go and gather the elders of israel together and say unto them the lord the god of your fathers the god of abraham of isaac a',\n",

thou and the elders of israel unto the king of egypt and ye shall say unto him the lord the god of the hebrews hath met with us and now let us go we pray thee three days journey into the wilderness that we may sacrifice to the lord our god and i know that the king of egypt will not give you leave to go except by a mighty hand and i will put forth my hand and smite egypt with all my wonders which i will do in the midst thereof and after that he will let you go and i will give this people favour in the sight of the egyptians and it shall come to pass that when ye go ye shall not go empty but every woman shall ask of her neighbour and of her that sojourneth in her house jewels of silver and jewels of gold and raiment and ye shall put them upon your sons and upon your daughters and ye shall spoil the egyptians and moses answered and said but behold they will not believe me nor hearken unto my voice for they will say the lord hath not appeared unto thee and the lord said unto him what is that in thy hand and he said a rod and he said cast it on the ground and he cast it on the ground and it became a serpent and moses fled from before it and the lord said unto moses put forth thy hand and take it by the tailand he put forth his hand and laid hold of it and it became a rod in his hand that they may believe that the lord the god of their fathers the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob hath appeared unto thee and the lord said furthermore unto him put now thy hand into thy bosom and he put his hand into his bosom and when he took it out behold his hand was leprous as white as snow and he said put thy hand back into thy bosomand he put his hand back into his bosom and when he took it out of his bosom behold it was turned again as his other flesh and it shall come to pass if they will not believe thee neither hearken to the voice of the first sign that they will believe the voice of the latter sign and it shall come to pass if they will not believe even these two signs neither hearken unto thy voice that thou shalt take of the water of the river and pour it upon the dry land and the water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land and moses said unto the lord oh lord i am not a man of words neither heretofore nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant for i am slow of speech and of a slow tongue and the lord said unto him who hath made mans mouth or who maketh a man dumb or deaf or seeing or blind is it not i the lord now therefore go and i will be with thy mouth and teach thee what thou shalt speak and he said oh lord send i pray thee by the hand of him whom thou wilt send and the anger of the lord was kindled against moses and he said is there not aaron thy brother the levite i know that he can speak well and also behold he cometh forth to meet thee and when he seeth thee he will be glad in his heart and thou shalt speak unto him and put the words in his mouth and i will be with thy mouth and with his mouth and will teach you what ye shall do and he shall be thy spokesman unto the people and it shall come to pass that he shall be to thee a mouth and thou shalt be to him in gods stead and thou shalt take in thy hand this rod wherewith thou shalt do the signs  and moses went and returned to jethro his fatherinlaw and said unto him let me go i pray thee and return unto my brethren that are in egypt and see whether they be yet alive and jethro said to moses go in peace and the lord said unto moses in midian go return into egypt for all the men are dead that sought thy life and moses took his wife and his sons and set them upon an ass and he returned to the land of egypt and moses took the rod of god in his hand and the lord said unto moses when thou goest back into egypt see that thou do before pharaoh all the wonders which i have put in thy hand but i will harden his heart and he will not let the people go and thou shalt say unto pharaoh thus saith the lord israel is my son my firstborn and i have said unto thee let my son go that he may serve me and thou hast refused to let him go behold i will slay thy son thy firstborn and it came to pass on the way at the lodgingplace that the lord met him and sought to kill him then zipporah took a flint and cut off the foreskin of her son and cast it at his feet and she said surely a bridegroom of blood art thou to me so he let him alone then she said a bridegroom of blood in regard of the circumcision  and the lord said to aaron go into the wilderness to meet moses and he went and met him in the mountain of god and kissed him and moses told aaron all the words of the lord wherewith he had sent him and all the signs wherewith he had charged him and moses and aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of israel and aaron spoke all the words which the lord had spoken unto moses and did the signs in the sight of the people and the people believed and when they heard that the lord had remembered the children of israel and that he had seen their affliction then they bowed their heads and worshipped and afterward moses and aaron came and said unto pharaoh thus saith the lord the god of israel let my people go that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness and pharaoh said who is the lord that i should hearken unto his voice to let israel go i know not the lord and moreover i will not let israel go and they said the god of the hebrews hath met with us let us go we pray thee three days journey into the wilderness and sacrifice unto the lord our god lest he fall upon us with pestilence or with the sword and the king of egypt said unto them wherefore do ye moses and aaron cause the people to break loose from their work get you unto your burdens and pharaoh said behold the people of the land are now many and will ye make them rest from their burdens and the same day pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people and their officers saying ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick as heretofore let them go and gather straw for themselves and the tale of the bricks which they did make heretofore ye shall lay upon them ye shall not diminish aught thereof for they are idle therefore they cry saying let us go and sacrifice to our god let heavier work be laid upon the men that they may labour therein and let them not regard lying words and the taskmasters of the people went out and their officers and they spoke to the people saying thus saith pharaoh i will not give you straw go yourselves get you straw where ye can find it for nought of your work shall be diminished so the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of egypt to gather stubble for straw and the taskmasters were urgent saying fulfil your work your daily task as when there was straw and the officers of the children of israel whom pharaohs taskmasters had set over them were beaten saying wherefore have ye not fulfilled your appointed task in making brick both yesterday and today as heretofore then the officers of the children of israel came and cried unto pharaoh saying wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servants there is no straw given unto thy

go therefore now and work for there shall no straw be given you yet shall ye deliver the tale of bricks and the officers of the children of israel did see that they were set on mischief when they said ye shall not diminish aught from your bricks your daily task and they met moses and aaron who stood in the way as they came forth from pharaoh and they said unto them the lord look upon you and judge

       "  'orth thy hand with thy rod over the rivers over the canals and over the pools and cause frogs to come up upon the land of egypt and aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of egypt and the frogs came up and covered the land of egypt and the magicians did in like manner with their secret arts and brought up frogs upon the land of egypt then pharaoh called for moses and aaron and said entreat the lord that he take away the frogs from me and from my people and i will let the people go that they may sacrifice unto the lord and moses said unto pharaoh have thou this glory over me against what time shall i entreat for thee and for thy servants and for thy people that the frogs be destroyed from thee and thy houses and remain in the river only and he said against tomorrow and he said be it according to thy word that thou mayest know that there is none like unto the lord our god and the frogs shall depart from thee and from thy houses and from thy servants and from thy people they shall remain in the river only and moses and aaron went out from pharaoh and moses cried unto the lord concerning the frogs which he had brought upon pharaoh and the lord did according to the word of moses and the frogs died out of the houses out of the courts and out of the fields and they gathered them together in heaps and the land stank but when pharaoh saw that there was respite he hardened his heart and hearkened not unto them as the lord had spoken s and the lord said unto moses say unto aaron stretch out thy rod and smite the dust of the earth that it may become gnats throughout all the land of egypt and they did so and aaron stretched out his hand with his rod and smote the dust of the earth and there were gnats upon man and upon beast all the dust of the earth became gnats throughout all the land of egypt and the magicians did so with their secret arts to bring forth gnats but they could not and there were gnats upon man and upon beast then the magicians said unto pharaoh this is the finger of god and pharaohs heart was hardened and he hearkened not unto them as the lord had spoken s and the lord said unto moses rise up early in the morning and stand before pharaoh lo he cometh forth to the water and say unto him thus saith the lord let my people go that they may serve me else if thou wilt not let my people go behold i will send swarms of flies upon thee and upon thy servants and upon thy people and into thy houses and the houses of the egyptians shall be full of swarms of flies and also the ground whereon they are and i will set apart in that day the land of goshen in which my people dwell that no swarms of flies shall be there to the end that thou mayest know that i am the lord in the midst of the earth and i will put a division between my people and thy peopleby tomorrow shall this sign be and the lord did so and there came grievous swarms of flies into the house of pharaoh and into his servants houses and in all the land of egypt the land was ruined by reason of the swarms of flies and pharaoh called for moses and for aaron and said go ye sacrifice to your god in the land and moses said it is not meet so to do for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the egyptians to the lord our god lo if we sacrifice the abomination of the egyptians before their eyes will they not stone us we will go three days journey into the wilderness and sacrifice to the lord our god as he shall command us and pharaoh said i will let you go that ye may sacrifice to the lord your god in the wilderness only ye shall not go very far away entreat for me and moses said behold i go out from thee and i will entreat the lord that the swarms of flies may depart from pharaoh from his servants and from his people tomorrow only let not pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the lord and moses went out from pharaoh and entreated the lord and the lord did according to the word of moses and he removed the swarms of flies from pharaoh from his servants and from his people there remained not one and pharaoh hardened his heart this time also and he did not let the people go  then the lord said unto moses go in unto pharaoh and tell him thus saith the lord the god of the hebrews let my people go that they may serve me for if thou refuse to let them go and wilt hold them still behold the hand of the lord is upon thy cattle which are in the field upon the horses upon the asses upon the camels upon the herds and upon the flocks there shall be a very grievous murrain and the lord shall make a division between the cattle of israel and the cattle of egypt and there shall nothing die of all that belongeth to the children of israel and the lord appointed a set time saying tomorrow the lord shall do this thing in the land and the lord did that thing on the morrow and all the cattle of egypt died but of the cattle of the children of israel died not one and pharaoh sent and behold there was not so much as one of the cattle of the israelites dead but the heart of pharaoh was stubborn and he did not let the people go  and the lord said unto moses and unto aaron take to you handfuls of soot of the furnace and let moses throw it heavenward in the sight of pharaoh and it shall become small dust over all the land of egypt and shall be a boil breaking forth with blains upon man and upon beast throughout all the land of egypt and they took soot of the furnace and stood before pharaoh and moses threw it up heavenward and it became a boil breaking forth with blains upon man and upon beast and the magicians could not stand before moses because of the boils for the boils were upon the magicians and upon all the egyptians and the lord hardened the heart of pharaoh and he hearkened not unto them as the lord had spoken unto moses s and the lord said unto moses rise up early in the morning and stand before pharaoh and say unto him thus saith the lord the god of the hebrews let my people go that they may serve me for i will this time send all my plagues upon thy person and upon thy servants and upon thy people that thou mayest know that there is none like me in all the earth surely now i had put forth my hand and smitten thee and thy people with pestilence and thou hadst been cut off from the earth but in very deed for this cause have i made thee to stand to show thee my power and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth as yet exaltest thou thyself against my people that thou wilt not let them go behold tomorrow about this time i will cause it to rain a very grievous hail such as hath not been in egypt since the day it was founded even until now now therefore send hasten in thy cattle and all that thou hast in the field for every man and beast that shall be found in the field and shall not be brought home the hail shall come down upon them and they shall die he that feared the word of the lord among the servants of pharaoh made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses and he that regarded not the word of the lord left his servants and his cattle in the field  and the lord said unto moses stretch forth thy hand toward heaven that there may be hail in all the land of egypt upon man and upon beast and upon every herb of the field throughout the land of egypt and moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven and the lord sent thunder and hail and fire ran down unto the earth and the lord caused to hail upon the land of egypt so there was hail and fire flashing up amidst the hail very grievous such as had not been in all the land of egypt since it became a nation and the hail smote throughout all the land of egypt all that was in the field both man and beast and the hail smote every herb of the field and broke every tree of the field only in the land of goshen where the children of israel were was there no hail and pharaoh sent and called for moses and aaron and said unto them i have sinned this time the lord is righteous and i and my people are wicked entreat the lord and let there be enough of these mighty thunderings and hail and i will let you go and ye shall stay no longer and moses said unto him as soon as i am gone out of the city i will spread forth my hands unto the lord the thunders shall cease neith',\n",
       "  'er shall there be any more hail that thou mayest know that the earth is the lords but as for thee and thy servants i know that ye will not yet fear the lord god and the flax and the barley were smitten for the barley was in the ear and the flax was in bloom but the wheat and the spelt were not smitten for they ripen late and moses went out of the city from pharaoh and spread forth his hands unto the lord and the thunders and hail ceased and the rain was not poured upon the earth and when pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders were ceased he sinned yet more and hardened his heart he and his servants and the heart of pharaoh was hardened and he did not let the children of israel go as the lord had spoken by moses  and the lord said unto moses go in unto pharaoh for i have hardened his heart and the heart of his servants that i might show these my signs in the midst of them and that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son and of thy sons son what i have wrought upon egypt and my signs which i have done among them that ye may know that i am the lord and moses and aaron went in unto pharaoh and said unto him thus saith the lord the god of the hebrews how long wilt thou refuse to humble thyself before me let my people go that they may serve me else if thou refuse to let my people go behold tomorrow will i bring locusts into thy border and they shall cover the face of the earth that one shall not be able to see the earth and they shall eat the residue of that which is escaped which remaineth unto you from the hail and shall eat every tree which groweth for you out of the field and thy houses shall be filled and the houses of all thy servants and the houses of all the egyptians as neither thy fathers nor thy fathers fathers have seen since the day that they were upon the earth unto this day and he turned and went out from pharaoh and pharaohs servants said unto him how long shall this man be a snare unto us let the men go that they may serve the lord their god knowest thou not yet that egypt is destroyed and moses and aaron were brought again unto pharaoh and he said unto them go serve the lord your god but who are they that shall go and moses said we will go with our young and with our old with our sons and with our daughters with our flocks and with our herds we will go for we must hold a feast unto the lord and he said unto them so be the lord with you as i will let you go and your little ones see ye that evil is before your face not so go now ye that are men and serve the lord for that is what ye desire and they were driven out from pharaohs presence s and the lord said unto moses stretch out thy hand over the land of egypt for the locusts that they may come up upon the land of egypt and eat every herb of the land even all that the hail hath left and moses stretched forth his rod over the land of egypt and the lord brought an east wind upon the land all that day and all the night and when it was morning the east wind brought the locusts and the locusts went up over all the land of egypt and rested in all the borders of egypt very grievous were they before them there were no such locusts as they neither after them shall be such for they covered the face of the whole earth so that the land was darkened and they did eat every herb of the land and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left and there remained not any green thing either tree or herb of the field through all the land of egypt then pharaoh called for moses and aaron in haste and he said i have sinned against the lord your god and against you now therefore forgive i pray thee my sin only this once and entreat the lord your god that he may take away from me this death only and he went out from pharaoh and entreated the lord and the lord turned an exceeding strong west wind which took up the locusts and drove them into the red sea there remained not one locust in all the border of egypt but the lord hardened pharaohs heart and he did not let the children of israel go  and the lord said unto moses stretch out thy hand toward heaven that there may be darkness over the land of egypt even darkness which may be felt and moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven and there was a thick darkness in all the land of egypt three days they saw not one another neither rose any from his place for three days but all the children of israel had light in their dwellings and pharaoh called unto moses and said go ye serve the lord only let your flocks and your herds be stayed let your little ones also go with you and moses said thou must also give into our hand sacrifices and burntofferings that we may sacrifice unto the lord our god our cattle also shall go with us there shall not a hoof be left behind for thereof must we take to serve the lord our god and we know not with what we must serve the lord until we come thither but the lord hardened pharaohs heart and he would not let them go and pharaoh said unto him get thee from me take heed to thyself see my face no more for in the day thou seest my face thou shalt die and moses said thou hast spoken well i will see thy face again no more  and the lord said unto moses yet one plague more will i bring upon pharaoh and upon egypt afterwards he will let you go hence when he shall let you go he shall surely thrust you out hence altogether speak now in the ears of the people and let them ask every man of his neighbour and every woman of her neighbour jewels of silver and jewels of gold and the lord gave the people favour in the sight of the egyptians moreover the man moses was very great in the land of egypt in the sight of pharaohs servants and in the sight of the people s and moses said thus saith the lord about midnight will i go out into the midst of egypt and all the firstborn in the land of egypt shall die from the firstborn of pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne even unto the firstborn of the maidservant that is behind the mill and all the firstborn of cattle and there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of egypt such as there hath been none like it nor shall be like it any more but against any of the children of israel shall not a dog whet his tongue against man or beast that ye may know how that the lord doth put a difference between the egyptians and israel and all these thy servants shall come down unto me and bow down unto me saying get thee out and all the people that follow thee and after that i will go out and he went out from pharaoh in hot anger s and the lord said unto moses pharaoh will not hearken unto you that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of egypt and moses and aaron did all these wonders before pharaoh and the lord hardened pharaohs heart and he did not let the children of israel go out of his land s and the lord spoke unto moses and aaron in the land of egypt saying this month shall be unto you the beginning of months it shall be the first month of the year to you speak ye unto all the congregation of israel saying in the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb according to their fathers houses a lamb for a household and if the household be too little for a lamb then shall he and his neighbour next unto his house take one according to the number of the souls according to every mans eating ye shall make your count for the lamb your lamb shall be without blemish a male of the first year ye shall take it from the sheep or from the goats and ye shall keep it unto the fourteenth day of the same month and the whole assembly of the congregation of israel shall kill it at dusk and they shall take of the blood and put it on the two sideposts and on the lintel upon the houses wherein they shall eat it and they shall eat the flesh in that night roast with fire and unleavened bread with bitter herbs they shall eat it eat not of it raw nor sodden at all with water but roast with fire its head with its legs and with the inwards thereof and ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning but that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire and thus shall ye eat it with your loins girded your shoes on your feet and your staff in your hand and ye shall eat it in hasteit is the lords passover for i wil',\n",
       "  'l go through the land of egypt in that night and will smite all the firstborn in the land of egypt both man and beast and against all the gods of egypt i will execute judgments i am the lord and the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are and when i see the blood i will pass over you and there shall no plague be upon you to destroy you when i smite the land of egypt and this day shall be unto you for a memorial and ye shall keep it a feast to the lord throughout your generations ye shall keep it a feast by an ordinance for ever seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread howbeit the first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses for whosoever eateth leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day that soul shall be cut off from israel and in the first day there shall be to you a holy convocation and in the seventh day a holy convocation no manner of work shall be done in them save that which every man must eat that only may be done by you and ye shall observe the feast of unleavened bread for in this selfsame day have i brought your hosts out of the land of egypt therefore shall ye observe this day throughout your generations by an ordinance for ever in the first month on the fourteenth day of the month at even ye shall eat unleavened bread until the one and twentieth day of the month at even seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses for whosoever eateth that which is leavened that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of israel whether he be a sojourner or one that is born in the land ye shall eat nothing leavened in all your habitations shall ye eat unleavened bread  then moses called for all the elders of israel and said unto them draw out and take you lambs according to your families and kill the passover lamb and ye shall take a bunch of hyssop and dip it in the blood that is in the basin and strike the lintel and the two sideposts with the blood that is in the basin and none of you shall go out of the door of his house until the morning for the lord will pass through to smite the egyptians and when he seeth the blood upon the lintel and on the two sideposts the lord will pass over the door and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto your houses to smite you and ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy sons for ever and it shall come to pass when ye be come to the land which the lord will give you according as he hath promised that ye shall keep this service and it shall come to pass when your children shall say unto you what mean ye by this service that ye shall say it is the sacrifice of the lords passover for that he passed over the houses of the children of israel in egypt when he smote the egyptians and delivered our houses and the people bowed the head and worshipped and the children of israel went and did so as the lord had commanded moses and aaron so did they s and it came to pass at midnight that the lord smote all the firstborn in the land of egypt from the firstborn of pharaoh that sat on his throne unto the firstborn of the captive that was in the dungeon and all the firstborn of cattle and pharaoh rose up in the night he and all his servants and all the egyptians and there was a great cry in egypt for there was not a house where there was not one dead and he called for moses and aaron by night and said rise up get you forth from among my people both ye and the children of israel and go serve the lord as ye have said take both your flocks and your herds as ye have said and be gone and bless me also and the egyptians were urgent upon the people to send them out of the land in haste for they said we are all dead men and the people took their dough before it was leavened their kneadingtroughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders and the children of israel did according to the word of moses and they asked of the egyptians jewels of silver and jewels of gold and raiment and the lord gave the people favour in the sight of the egyptians so that they let them have what they asked and they despoiled the egyptians  and the children of israel journeyed from rameses to succoth about six hundred thousand men on foot beside children and a mixed multitude went up also with them and flocks and herds even very much cattle and they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth out of egypt for it was not leavened because they were thrust out of egypt and could not tarry neither had they prepared for themselves any victual now the time that the children of israel dwelt in egypt was four hundred and thirty years and it came to pass at the end of four hundred and thirty years even the selfsame day it came to pass that all the host of the lord went out from the land of egypt it was a night of watching unto the lord for bringing them out from the land of egypt this same night is a night of watching unto the lord for all the children of israel throughout their generations  and the lord said unto moses and aaron this is the ordinance of the passover there shall no alien eat thereof but every mans servant that is bought for money when thou hast circumcised him then shall he eat thereof a sojourner and a hired servant shall not eat thereof in one house shall it be eaten thou shalt not carry forth aught of the flesh abroad out of the house neither shall ye break a bone thereof all the congregation of israel shall keep it and when a stranger shall sojourn with thee and will keep the passover to the lord let all his males be circumcised and then let him come near and keep it and he shall be as one that is born in the land but no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof one law shall be to him that is homeborn and unto the stranger that sojourneth among you thus did all the children of israel as the lord commanded moses and aaron so did they s and it came to pass the selfsame day that the lord did bring the children of israel out of the land of egypt by their hosts  and the lord spoke unto moses saying sanctify unto me all the firstborn whatsoever openeth the womb among the children of israel both of man and of beast it is mine and moses said unto the people remember this day in which ye came out from egypt out of the house of bondage for by strength of hand the lord brought you out from this place there shall no leavened bread be eaten this day ye go forth in the month abib and it shall be when the lord shall bring thee into the land of the canaanite and the hittite and the amorite and the hivite and the jebusite which he swore unto thy fathers to give thee a land flowing with milk and honey that thou shalt keep this service in this month seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread and in the seventh day shall be a feast to the lord unleavened bread shall be eaten throughout the seven days and there shall no leavened bread be seen with thee neither shall there be leaven seen with thee in all thy borders and thou shalt tell thy son in that day saying it is because of that which the lord did for me when i came forth out of egypt and it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thy hand and for a memorial between thine eyes that the law of the lord may be in thy mouth for with a strong hand hath the lord brought thee out of egypt thou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in its season from year to year  and it shall be when the lord shall bring thee into the land of the canaanite as he swore unto thee and to thy fathers and shall give it thee that thou shalt set apart unto the lord all that openeth the womb every firstling that is a male which thou hast coming of a beast shall be the lords and every firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb and if thou wilt not redeem it then thou shalt break its neck and all the firstborn of man among thy sons shalt thou redeem and it shall be when thy son asketh thee in time to come saying what is this that thou shalt say unto him by strength of hand the lord brought us out from egypt from the house of bondage and it came to pass when pharaoh would hardly let us go that the lord slew all the firstborn in the land of egypt both the firstborn of man and the firstborn of beast therefore i sacrifice to the lord all that openeth the womb being males but',\n",
       "  ' all the firstborn of my sons i redeem and it shall be for a sign upon thy hand and for frontlets between thine eyes for by strength of hand the lord brought us forth out of egypt s and it came to pass when pharaoh had let the people go that god led them not by the way of the land of the philistines although that was near for god said lest peradventure the people repent when they see war and they return to egypt but god led the people about by the way of the wilderness by the red sea and the children of israel went up armed out of the land of egypt and moses took the bones of joseph with him for he had straitly sworn the children of israel saying god will surely remember you and ye shall carry up my bones away hence with you and they took their journey from succoth and encamped in etham in the edge of the wilderness and the lord went before them by day in a pillar of cloud to lead them the way and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light that they might go by day and by night the pillar of cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night departed not from before the people  and the lord spoke unto moses saying speak unto the children of israel that they turn back and encamp before pihahiroth between migdol and the sea before baalzephon over against it shall ye encamp by the sea and pharaoh will say of the children of israel they are entangled in the land the wilderness hath shut them in and i will harden pharaohs heart and he shall follow after them and i will get me honour upon pharaoh and upon all his host and the egyptians shall know that i am the lord and they did so and it was told the king of egypt that the people were fled and the heart of pharaoh and of his servants was turned towards the people and they said what is this we have done that we have let israel go from serving us and he made ready his chariots and took his people with him and he took six hundred chosen chariots and all the chariots of egypt and captains over all of them and the lord hardened the heart of pharaoh king of egypt and he pursued after the children of israel for the children of israel went out with a high hand and the egyptians pursued after them all the horses and chariots of pharaoh and his horsemen and his army and overtook them encamping by the sea beside pihahiroth in front of baalzephon and when pharaoh drew nigh the children of israel lifted up their eyes and behold the egyptians were marching after them and they were sore afraid and the children of israel cried out unto the lord and they said unto moses because there were no graves in egypt hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us to bring us forth out of egypt is not this the word that we spoke unto thee in egypt saying let us alone that we may serve the egyptians for it were better for us to serve the egyptians than that we should die in the wilderness and moses said unto the people fear ye not stand still and see the salvation of the lord which he will work for you today for whereas ye have seen the egyptians today ye shall see them again no more for ever the lord will fight for you and ye shall hold your peace  and the lord said unto moses wherefore criest thou unto me speak unto the children of israel that they go forward and lift thou up thy rod and stretch out thy hand over the sea and divide it and the children of israel shall go into the midst of the sea on dry ground and i behold i will harden the hearts of the egyptians and they shall go in after them and i will get me honour upon pharaoh and upon all his host upon his chariots and upon his horsemen and the egyptians shall know that i am the lord when i have gotten me honour upon pharaoh upon his chariots and upon his horsemen and the angel of god who went before the camp of israel removed and went behind them and the pillar of cloud removed from before them and stood behind them and it came between the camp of egypt and the camp of israel and there was the cloud and the darkness here yet gave it light by night there and the one came not near the other all the night and moses stretched out his hand over the sea and the lord caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all the night and made the sea dry land and the waters were divided and the children of israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand and on their left and the egyptians pursued and went in after them into the midst of the sea all pharaohs horses his chariots and his horsemen and it came to pass in the morning watch that the lord looked forth upon the host of the egyptians through the pillar of fire and of cloud and discomfited the host of the egyptians and he took off their chariot wheels and made them to drive heavily so that the egyptians said let us flee from the face of israel for the lord fighteth for them against the egyptians  and the lord said unto moses stretch out thy hand over the sea that the waters may come back upon the egyptians upon their chariots and upon their horsemen and moses stretched forth his hand over the sea and the sea returned to its strength when the morning appeared and the egyptians fled against it and the lord overthrew the egyptians in the midst of the sea and the waters returned and covered the chariots and the horsemen even all the host of pharaoh that went in after them into the sea there remained not so much as one of them but the children of israel walked upon dry land in the midst of the sea and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand and on their left thus the lord saved israel that day out of the hand of the egyptians and israel saw the egyptians dead upon the seashore and israel saw the great work which the lord did upon the egyptians and the people feared the lord and they believed in the lord and in his servant moses  then sang moses and the children of israel this song unto the lord and spoke saying i will sing unto the lord for he is highly exalted the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea the lord is my strength and song and he is become my salvation this is my god and i will glorify him my fathers god and i will exalt him the lord is a man of war the lord is his name pharaohs chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea and his chosen captains are sunk in the red sea the deeps cover themthey went down into the depths like a stone thy right hand o lord glorious in power thy right hand o lord dasheth in pieces the enemy and in the greatness of thine excellency thou overthrowest them that rise up against thee thou sendest forth thy wrath it consumeth them as stubble and with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were piled upthe floods stood upright as a heap the deeps were congealed in the heart of the sea the enemy said i will pursue i will overtake i will divide the spoil my lust shall be satisfied upon them i will draw my sword my hand shall destroy them thou didst blow with thy wind the sea covered them they sank as lead in the mighty waters who is like unto thee o lord among the mighty who is like unto thee glorious in holiness fearful in praises doing wonders thou stretchedst out thy right handthe earth swallowed them thou in thy love hast led the people that thou hast redeemed thou hast guided them in thy strength to thy holy habitation the peoples have heard they tremble pangs have taken hold on the inhabitants of philistia then were the chiefs of edom affrighted the mighty men of moab trembling taketh hold upon them all the inhabitants of canaan are melted away terror and dread falleth upon them by the greatness of thine arm they are as still as a stone till thy people pass over o lord till the people pass over that thou hast gotten thou bringest them in and plantest them in the mountain of thine inheritance the place o lord which thou hast made for thee to dwell in the sanctuary o lord which thy hands have established the lord shall reign for ever and ever for the horses of pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea and the lord brought back the waters of the sea upon them but the children of israel walked on dry land in the midst of the sea  and miriam the prophetess the sister of aaron t',\n",
       "  'ook a timbrel in her hand and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances and miriam sang unto them sing ye to the lord for he is highly exalted the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea s and moses led israel onward from the red sea and they went out into the wilderness of shur and they went three days in the wilderness and found no water and when they came to marah they could not drink of the waters of marah for they were bitter therefore the name of it was called marah and the people murmured against moses saying what shall we drink and he cried unto the lord and the lord showed him a tree and he cast it into the waters and the waters were made sweet there he made for them a statute and an ordinance and there he proved them and he said if thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the lord thy god and wilt do that which is right in his eyes and wilt give ear to his commandments and keep all his statutes i will put none of the diseases upon thee which i have put upon the egyptians for i am the lord that healeth thee s and they came to elim where were twelve springs of water and three score and ten palmtrees and they encamped there by the waters and they took their journey from elim and all the congregation of the children of israel came unto the wilderness of sin which is between elim and sinai on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out of the land of egypt and the whole congregation of the children of israel murmured against moses and against aaron in the wilderness and the children of israel said unto them would that we had died by the hand of the lord in the land of egypt when we sat by the fleshpots when we did eat bread to the full for ye have brought us forth into this wilderness to kill this whole assembly with hunger s then said the lord unto moses behold i will cause to rain bread from heaven for you and the people shall go out and gather a days portion every day that i may prove them whether they will walk in my law or not and it shall come to pass on the sixth day that they shall prepare that which they bring in and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily and moses and aaron said unto all the children of israel at even then ye shall know that the lord hath brought you out from the land of egypt and in the morning then ye shall see the glory of the lord for that he hath heard your murmurings against the lord and what are we that ye murmur against us and moses said this shall be when the lord shall give you in the evening flesh to eat and in the morning bread to the full for that the lord heareth your murmurings which ye murmur against him and what are we your murmurings are not against us but against the lord and moses said unto aaron say unto all the congregation of the children of israel come near before the lord for he hath heard your murmurings and it came to pass as aaron spoke unto the whole congregation of the children of israel that they looked toward the wilderness and behold the glory of the lord appeared in the cloud  and the lord spoke unto moses saying i have heard the murmurings of the children of israel speak unto them saying at dusk ye shall eat flesh and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread and ye shall know that i am the lord your god and it came to pass at even that the quails came up and covered the camp and in the morning there was a layer of dew round about the camp and when the layer of dew was gone up behold upon the face of the wilderness a fine scalelike thing fine as the hoarfrost on the ground and when the children of israel saw it they said one to another what is itfor they knew not what it was and moses said unto them it is the bread which the lord hath given you to eat this is the thing which the lord hath commanded gather ye of it every man according to his eating an omer a head according to the number of your persons shall ye take it every man for them that are in his tent and the children of israel did so and gathered some more some less and when they did mete it with an omer he that gathered much had nothing over and he that gathered little had no lack they gathered every man according to his eating and moses said unto them let no man leave of it till the morning notwithstanding they hearkened not unto moses but some of them left of it until the morning and it bred worms and rotted and moses was wroth with them and they gathered it morning by morning every man according to his eating and as the sun waxed hot it melted and it came to pass that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread two omers for each one and all the rulers of the congregation came and told moses and he said unto them this is that which the lord hath spoken tomorrow is a solemn rest a holy sabbath unto the lord bake that which ye will bake and seethe that which ye will seethe and all that remaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morning and they laid it up till the morning as moses bade and it did not rot neither was there any worm therein and moses said eat that today for today is a sabbath unto the lord today ye shall not find it in the field six days ye shall gather it but on the seventh day is the sabbath in it there shall be none and it came to pass on the seventh day that there went out some of the people to gather and they found none s and the lord said unto moses how long refuse ye to keep my commandments and my laws see that the lord hath given you the sabbath therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days abide ye every man in his place let no man go out of his place on the seventh day so the people rested on the seventh day and the house of israel called the name thereof manna and it was like coriander seed white and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey and moses said this is the thing which the lord hath commanded let an omerful of it be kept throughout your generations that they may see the bread wherewith i fed you in the wilderness when i brought you forth from the land of egypt and moses said unto aaron take a jar and put an omerful of manna therein and lay it up before the lord to be kept throughout your generations as the lord commanded moses so aaron laid it up before the testimony to be kept and the children of israel did eat the manna forty years until they came to a land inhabited they did eat the manna until they came unto the borders of the land of canaan now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah  and all the congregation of the children of israel journeyed from the wilderness of sin by their stages according to the commandment of the lord and encamped in rephidim and there was no water for the people to drink wherefore the people strove with moses and said give us water that we may drink and moses said unto them why strive ye with me wherefore do ye try the lord and the people thirsted there for water and the people murmured against moses and said wherefore hast thou brought us up out of egypt to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst and moses cried unto the lord saying what shall i do unto this people they are almost ready to stone me and the lord said unto moses pass on before the people and take with thee of the elders of israel and thy rod wherewith thou smotest the river take in thy hand and go behold i will stand before thee there upon the rock in horeb and thou shalt smite the rock and there shall come water out of it that the people may drink and moses did so in the sight of the elders of israel and the name of the place was called massah and meribah because of the striving of the children of israel and because they tried the lord saying is the lord among us or not  then came amalek and fought with israel in rephidim and moses said unto joshua choose us out men and go out fight with amalek tomorrow i will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of god in my hand so joshua did as moses had said to him and fought with amalek and moses aaron and hur went up to the top of the hill and it came to pass when moses held up his hand that israel prevailed and when he let down his hand amalek prevailed but moses hands were heavy and they took a stone and put it under him and he sat thereon and aaron and hur stayed ',\n",
       "  'up his hands the one on the one side and the other on the other side and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun and joshua discomfited amalek and his people with the edge of the sword  and the lord said unto moses write this for a memorial in the book and rehearse it in the ears of joshua for i will utterly blot out the remembrance of amalek from under heaven and moses built an altar and called the name of it adonainissi and he said the hand upon the throne of the lord the lord will have war with amalek from generation to generation  now jethro the priest of midian moses fatherinlaw heard of all that god had done for moses and for israel his people how that the lord had brought israel out of egypt and jethro moses fatherinlaw took zipporah moses wife after he had sent her away and her two sons of whom the name of the one was gershom for he said i have been a stranger in a strange land and the name of the other was eliezer for the god of my father was my help and delivered me from the sword of pharaoh and jethro moses fatherinlaw came with his sons and his wife unto moses into the wilderness where he was encamped at the mount of god and he said unto moses i thy fatherinlaw jethro am coming unto thee and thy wife and her two sons with her and moses went out to meet his fatherinlaw and bowed down and kissed him and they asked each other of their welfare and they came into the tent and moses told his fatherinlaw all that the lord had done unto pharaoh and to the egyptians for israels sake all the travail that had come upon them by the way and how the lord delivered them and jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the lord had done to israel in that he had delivered them out of the hand of the egyptians and jethro said blessed be the lord who hath delivered you out of the hand of the egyptians and out of the hand of pharaoh who hath delivered the people from under the hand of the egyptians now i know that the lord is greater than all gods yea for that they dealt proudly against them and jethro moses fatherinlaw took a burntoffering and sacrifices for god and aaron came and all the elders of israel to eat bread with moses fatherinlaw before god and it came to pass on the morrow that moses sat to judge the people and the people stood about moses from the morning unto the evening and when moses fatherinlaw saw all that he did to the people he said what is this thing that thou doest to the people why sittest thou thyself alone and all the people stand about thee from morning unto even and moses said unto his fatherinlaw because the people come unto me to inquire of god when they have a matter it cometh unto me and i judge between a man and his neighbour and i make them know the statutes of god and his laws and moses fatherinlaw said unto him the thing that thou doest is not good thou wilt surely wear away both thou and this people that is with thee for the thing is too heavy for thee thou art not able to perform it thyself alone hearken now unto my voice i will give thee counsel and god be with thee be thou for the people before god and bring thou the causes unto god and thou shalt teach them the statutes and the laws and shalt show them the way wherein they must walk and the work that they must do moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men such as fear god men of truth hating unjust gain and place such over them to be rulers of thousands rulers of hundreds rulers of fifties and rulers of tens and let them judge the people at all seasons and it shall be that every great matter they shall bring unto thee but every small matter they shall judge themselves so shall they make it easier for thee and bear the burden with thee if thou shalt do this thing and god command thee so then thou shalt be able to endure and all this people also shall go to their place in peace so moses hearkened to the voice of his fatherinlaw and did all that he had said and moses chose able men out of all israel and made them heads over the people rulers of thousands rulers of hundreds rulers of fifties and rulers of tens and they judged the people at all seasons the hard causes they brought unto moses but every small matter they judged themselves and moses let his fatherinlaw depart and he went his way into his own land  in the third month after the children of israel were gone forth out of the land of egypt the same day came they into the wilderness of sinai and when they were departed from rephidim and were come to the wilderness of sinai they encamped in the wilderness and there israel encamped before the mount and moses went up unto god and the lord called unto him out of the mountain saying thus shalt thou say to the house of jacob and tell the children of israel ye have seen what i did unto the egyptians and how i bore you on eagles wings and brought you unto myself now therefore if ye will hearken unto my voice indeed and keep my covenant then ye shall be mine own treasure from among all peoples for all the earth is mine and ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation these are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of israel and moses came and called for the elders of the people and set before them all these words which the lord commanded him and all the people answered together and said all that the lord hath spoken we will do and moses reported the words of the people unto the lord and the lord said unto moses lo i come unto thee in a thick cloud that the people may hear when i speak with thee and may also believe thee for ever and moses told the words of the people unto the lord and the lord said unto moses go unto the people and sanctify them today and tomorrow and let them wash their garments and be ready against the third day for the third day the lord will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount sinai and thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about saying take heed to yourselves that ye go not up into the mount or touch the border of it whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to death no hand shall touch him but he shall surely be stoned or shot through whether it be beast or man it shall not live when the rams horn soundeth long they shall come up to the mount and moses went down from the mount unto the people and sanctified the people and they washed their garments and he said unto the people be ready against the third day come not near a woman and it came to pass on the third day when it was morning that there were thunders and lightnings and a thick cloud upon the mount and the voice of a horn exceeding loud and all the people that were in the camp trembled and moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet god and they stood at the nether part of the mount now mount sinai was altogether on smoke because the lord descended upon it in fire and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace and the whole mount quaked greatly and when the voice of the horn waxed louder and louder moses spoke and god answered him by a voice and the lord came down upon mount sinai to the top of the mount and the lord called moses to the top of the mount and moses went up and the lord said unto moses go down charge the people lest they break through unto the lord to gaze and many of them perish and let the priests also that come near to the lord sanctify themselves lest the lord break forth upon them and moses said unto the lord the people cannot come up to mount sinai for thou didst charge us saying set bounds about the mount and sanctify it and the lord said unto him go get thee down and thou shalt come up thou and aaron with thee but let not the priests and the people break through to come up unto the lord lest he break forth upon them so moses went down unto the people and told them s and god spoke all these words saying s i am the lord thy god who brought thee out of the land of egypt out of the house of bondage thou shalt have no other gods before me thou shalt not make unto thee a graven image nor any manner of likeness of any thing that is in heaven above or that is in the earth beneath or that is in the water under the earth thou shalt not bow down unto them nor serve them for i the lord thy god am a jealous god ',\n",

the people saw it they trembled and stood afar off and they said unto moses speak thou with us and we will hear but let not god speak with us lest we die and moses said unto the people fear not for

rested s and he gave unto moses when he had made an end of speaking with him upon mount sinai the two tables of the testimony tables of stone written with the finger of god and when the people saw that moses delayed to come down from the mount the people gathered themselves together unto aaron and said unto him up make us a god who shall go before us for as for this moses the man that brought us up out of the land of egypt we know not what is become of him and aaron said unto them break off the golden rings which are in the ears of your wives of your sons and of your daughters and bring them unto me and all the people broke off the golden rings which were in their ears and brought them unto aaron and he received it at their hand and fashioned it with a graving tool and made it a molten calf and they said this is thy god o israel which brought thee up out of the land of egypt and when aaron saw this he built an altar before it and aaron made proclamation and said tomorrow shall be a feast to the lord and they rose up early on the morrow and offered burntofferings and brought peaceofferings and the people sat down to eat and to drink and rose up to make merry  and the lord spoke unto moses go get thee down for thy people that thou broughtest up out of the land of egypt have dealt corruptly they have turned aside quickly out of the way which i commanded them they have made them a molten calf and have worshipped it and have sacrificed unto it and said this is thy god o israel which brought thee up out of the land of egypt and the lord said unto moses i have seen this people and behold it is a stiffnecked people now therefore let me alone that my wrath may wax hot against them and that i may consume them and i will make of thee a great nation and moses besought the lord his god and said lord why doth thy wrath wax hot against thy people that thou hast brought forth out of the land of egypt with great power and with a mighty hand wherefore should the egyptians speak saying for evil did he bring them forth to slay them in the mountains and to consume them from the face of the earth turn from thy fierce wrath and repent of this evil against thy people remember abraham isaac and israel thy servants to whom thou didst swear by thine own self and saidst unto them i will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven and all this land that i have spoken of will i give unto your seed and they shall inherit it for ever and the lord repented of the evil which he said he would do unto his people  and moses turned and went down from the mount with the two tables of the testimony in his hand tables that were written on both their sides on the one side and on the other were they written and the tables were the work of god and the writing was the writing of god graven upon the tables and when joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted he said unto moses there is a noise of war in the camp and he said it is not the voice of them that shout for mastery neither is it the voice of them that cry for being overcome but the noise of them that sing do i hear and it came to pass as soon as he came nigh unto the camp that he saw the calf and the dancing and moses anger waxed hot and he cast the tables out of his hands and broke them beneath the mount and he took the calf which they had made and burnt it with fire and ground it to powder and strewed it upon the water and made the children of israel drink of it and moses said unto aaron what did this people unto thee that thou hast brought a great sin upon them and aaron said let not the anger of my lord wax hot thou knowest the people that they are set on evil so they said unto me make us a god which shall go before us for as for this moses the man that brought us up out of the land of egypt we know not what is become of him and i said unto them whosoever hath any gold let them break it off so they gave it me and i cast it into the fire and there came out this calf and when moses saw that the people were broken loosefor aaron had let them loose for a derision among their enemies then moses stood in the gate of the camp and said whoso is on the lords side let him come unto me and all the sons of levi gathered themselves together unto him and he said unto them thus saith the lord the god of israel put ye every man his sword upon his thigh and go to and fro from gate to gate throughout the camp and slay every man his brother and every man his companion and every man his neighbour and the sons of levi did according to the word of moses and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men and moses said consecrate yourselves today to the lord for every man hath been against his son and against his brother that he may also bestow upon you a blessing this day and it came to pass on the morrow that moses said unto the people ye have sinned a great sin and now i will go up unto the lord peradventure i shall make atonement for your sin and moses returned unto the lord and said oh this people have sinned a great sin and have made them a god of gold yet now if thou wilt forgive their sin and if not blot me i pray thee out of thy book which thou hast written and the lord said unto moses whosoever hath sinned against me him will i blot out of my book and now go lead the people unto the place of which i have spoken unto thee behold mine angel shall go before thee nevertheless in the day when i visit i will visit their sin upon them and the lord smote the people because they made the calf which aaron made s and the lord spoke unto moses depart go up hence thou and the people that thou hast brought up out of the land of egypt unto the land of which i swore unto abraham to isaac and to jacob saying unto thy seed will i give it and i will send an angel before thee and i will drive out the canaanite the amorite and the hittite and the perizzite the hivite and the jebusite unto a land flowing with milk and honey for i will not go up in the midst of thee for thou art a stiffnecked people lest i consume thee in the way and when the people heard these evil tidings they mourned and no man did put on him his ornaments and the lord said unto moses say unto the children of israel ye are a stiffnecked people if i go up into the midst of thee for one moment i shall consume thee therefore now put off thy ornaments from thee that i may know what to do unto thee and the children of israel stripped themselves of their ornaments from mount horeb onward now moses used to take the tent and to pitch it without the camp afar off from the camp and he called it the tent of meeting and it came to pass that every one that sought the lord went out unto the tent of meeting which was without the camp and it came to pass when moses went out unto the tent that all the people rose up and stood every man at his tent door and looked after moses until he was gone into the tent and it came to pass when moses entered into the tent the pillar of cloud descended and stood at the door of the tent and  spoke with moses and when all the people saw the pillar of cloud stand at the door of the tent all the people rose up and worshipped every man at his tent door and the lord spoke unto moses face to face as a man speaketh unto his friend and he would return into the camp but his minister joshua the son of nun a young man departed not out of the tent  and moses said unto the lord see thou sayest unto me bring up this people and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send with me yet thou hast said i know thee by name and thou hast also found grace in my sight now therefore i pray thee if i have found grace in thy sight show me now thy ways that i may know thee to the end that i may find grace in thy sight and consider that this nation is thy people and he said my presence shall go with thee and i will give thee rest and he said',\n",
       "  ' unto him if thy presence go not with me carry us not up hence for wherein now shall it be known that i have found grace in thy sight i and thy people is it not in that thou goest with us so that we are distinguished i and thy people from all the people that are upon the face of the earth  and the lord said unto moses i will do this thing also that thou hast spoken for thou hast found grace in my sight and i know thee by name and he said show me i pray thee thy glory and he said i will make all my goodness pass before thee and will proclaim the name of the lord before thee and i will be gracious to whom i will be gracious and will show mercy on whom i will show mercy and he said thou canst not see my face for man shall not see me and live and the lord said behold there is a place by me and thou shalt stand upon the rock and it shall come to pass while my glory passeth by that i will put thee in a cleft of the rock and will cover thee with my hand until i have passed by and i will take away my hand and thou shalt see my back but my face shall not be seen  and the lord said unto moses hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first and i will write upon the tables the words that were on the first tables which thou didst break and be ready by the morning and come up in the morning unto mount sinai and present thyself there to me on the top of the mount and no man shall come up with thee neither let any man be seen throughout all the mount neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that mount and he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first and moses rose up early in the morning and went up unto mount sinai as the lord had commanded him and took in his hand two tables of stone and the lord descended in the cloud and stood with him there and proclaimed the name of the lord and the lord passed by before him and proclaimed the lord the lord god merciful and gracious longsuffering and abundant in goodness and truth keeping mercy unto the thousandth generation forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin and that will by no means clear the guilty visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children and upon the childrens children unto the third and unto the fourth generation and moses made haste and bowed his head toward the earth and worshipped and he said if now i have found grace in thy sight o lord let the lord i pray thee go in the midst of us for it is a stiffnecked people and pardon our iniquity and our sin and take us for thine inheritance and he said behold i make a covenant before all thy people i will do marvels such as have not been wrought in all the earth nor in any nation and all the people among which thou art shall see the work of the lord that i am about to do with thee that it is tremendous observe thou that which i am commanding thee this day behold i am driving out before thee the amorite and the canaanite and the hittite and the perizzite and the hivite and the jebusite take heed to thyself lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land whither thou goest lest they be for a snare in the midst of thee but ye shall break down their altars and dash in pieces their pillars and ye shall cut down their asherim for thou shalt bow down to no other god for the lord whose name is jealous is a jealous god lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land and they go astray after their gods and do sacrifice unto their gods and they call thee and thou eat of their sacrifice and thou take of their daughters unto thy sons and their daughters go astray after their gods and make thy sons go astray after their gods thou shalt make thee no molten gods the feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread as i commanded thee at the time appointed in the month abib for in the month abib thou camest out from egypt all that openeth the womb is mine and of all thy cattle thou shalt sanctify the males the firstlings of ox and sheep and the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb and if thou wilt not redeem it then thou shalt break its neck all the firstborn of thy sons thou shalt redeem and none shall appear before me empty six days thou shalt work but on the seventh day thou shalt rest in plowing time and in harvest thou shalt rest and thou shalt observe the feast of weeks even of the firstfruits of wheat harvest and the feast of ingathering at the turn of the year three times in the year shall all thy males appear before the lord god the god of israel for i will cast out nations before thee and enlarge thy borders neither shall any man covet thy land when thou goest up to appear before the lord thy god three times in the year thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left unto the morning the choicest firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring unto the house of the lord thy god thou shalt not seethe a kid in its mothers milk  and the lord said unto moses write thou these words for after the tenor of these words i have made a covenant with thee and with israel and he was there with the lord forty days and forty nights he did neither eat bread nor drink water and he wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant the ten words and it came to pass when moses came down from mount sinai with the two tables

saw moses behold the skin of his face sent forth beams and they were afraid to come nigh him and moses called unto them and aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned unto him and moses spoke to them and afterward all the children of israel came nigh and he gave them in commandment all that the lord had spoken with him in mount sinai and when moses had done speaking with them he put a veil on his face but when moses went in before the lord that he might speak with him he took the veil off until he came out and he came out and spoke unto the children of israel that which he was commanded and the children of israel saw the face of moses that the skin of moses face sent forth beams and moses put the veil back upon his face until he went in to speak with him s and moses assembled all the congregation of the children of israel and said unto them these are the words which the lord hath commanded that ye should do them six days shall work be done but on the seventh day there shall be to you a holy day a sabbath of solemn rest to the lord whosoever doeth any work therein shall be put to death ye shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations upon the sabbath day

were they taken out\\xa0 some of them also were appointed over the furniture and over all the holy vessels and over the fine flour and the wine and the oil and the frankincense and the spices\\xa0 and some of the sons of the priests prepared the confection of the spices\\xa0 and mattithia',\n",
       "  'h one of the levites who was the firstborn of shallum the korahite had the set office over the things that were baked on griddles\\xa0 and some of their brethren of the sons of the kohathites were over the showbread to prepare it every sabbath\\xa0 and these are the singers heads of fathers houses of the levites who dwelt in the chambers and were free from other service for they were employed in their work day and night\\xa0 these were heads of fathers houses of the levites by their generations chief men these dwelt at jerusalem s\\xa0 and in gibeon there dwelt the father of gibeon jeiel whose wifes name was maacah\\xa0 and his firstborn son abdon and zur and kish and baal and ner and nadab\\xa0 and gedor and ahio and zechariah and mikloth\\xa0 and mikloth begot shimeam

these were the sons of azel \\xa0 now the philistines fought against israel and the men of israel fled from before the philistines and fell down slain in mount gilboa\\xa0 and the philistines followed hard after saul and after his sons and the philistines slew jonathan and abinadab and malchishua the sons of saul\\xa0 and the battle went sore against saul and the archers overtook him and he was in anguish by reason of the archers\\xa0 then said saul unto his armourbearer draw thy sword and thrust me through therewith lest these uncircumcised come and make a mock of me but his armourbearer would not for he was sore afraid s therefore saul took his sword and fell upon it\\xa0 and when his armourbearer saw that saul was dead he likewise fell upon his sword and died s\\xa0 so saul died and his three sons and all his house died together\\xa0 and when all the men of israel that were in the valley saw that  fled and that saul and his sons were dead they forsook their cities and fled and the philistines came and dwelt in them s\\xa0 and it came to pass on the morrow when the philistines came to strip the slain that they found saul and his sons fallen in mount gilboa\\xa0 and they stripped him and took his head and his armour and sent into the land of the philistines round about to carry the tidings unto their idols and to the people\\xa0 and they put his armour in the house of their gods and fastened his head in the house of dagon s\\xa0 and when all jabeshgilead heard all that the philistines had done to saul\\xa0 all the valiant men arose and took away the body of saul and the bodies of his sons and brought them to jabesh and buried their bones under the terebinth in jabesh and fasted seven days\\xa0 so saul died for his transgression which he committed against the lord because of the word of the lord which he kept not and also for that he asked counsel of a ghost to inquire thereby\\xa0 and inquired not of the lord therefore he slew him and turned the kingdom unto david the son of jesse \\xa0 then all israel gathered themselves to david unto hebron saying behold we are thy bone and thy flesh\\xa0 in times past even when saul was king it was thou that didst lead out and bring in israel and the lord thy god said unto thee thou shalt feed my people israel and thou shalt be prince over my people israel\\xa0 so all the elders of israel came to the king to hebron and david made a covenant with them in hebron before the lord and they anointed david king over israel according to the word of the lord by the hand of samuel s\\xa0 and david and all israel went to jerusalemthe same is jebusand the jebusites the inhabitants of the land were there\\xa0 and the inhabitants of jebus said to david thou shalt not come in hither nevertheless david took the stronghold of zion the same is the city of david\\xa0 and david said whosoever smiteth the jebusites first shall be chief and captain and joab the son of zeruiah went up first and was made chief\\xa0 and david dwelt in the stronghold therefore they called it the city of david\\xa0 and he built the city round about from millo even round about and joab repaired the rest of the city\\xa0 and david waxed greater and greater for the lord of hosts was with him \\xa0 now these are the chief of the mighty men whom david had who held strongly with him in his kingdom together with all israel to make him king according to the word of the lord concerning israel s\\xa0 and this is the number of the mighty men whom david had jashobeam the son of a hachmonite the chief of the captains he lifted up his spear against three hundred and slew them at one time\\xa0 and after him was eleazar the son of dodo the ahohite who was one of the three mighty men\\xa0 he was with david at pasdammim and there the philistines were gathered together to battle where was a plot of ground full of barley and the people fled from before the philistines\\xa0 but they stood in the midst of the plot and defended it and slew the philistines and the lord saved them by a great victory\\xa0 and three of the thirty chiefs went down to the rock to david unto the cave of adullam and the host of the philistines were encamped in the valley of rephaim\\xa0 and david was then in the stronghold and the garrison of the philistines was then in bethlehem\\xa0 and david longed and said oh that one would give me water to drink of the well of bethlehem which is by the gate\\xa0 and the three broke through the host of the philistines and drew water out of the well of bethlehem that was by the gate and took it and brought it to david but david would not drink thereof but poured it out unto the lord\\xa0 and said my god forbid it me that i should do this shall i drink the blood of these men that have put their lives in jeopardy for with the jeopardy of their lives they brought it therefore he would not drink it these things did the three mighty men\\xa0 and abishai the brother of joab he was chief of the three for he lifted up his spear against three hundred and slew them and had a name among the three\\xa0 of the three in the second rank he was the most honourable and was made their captain howbeit he attained not to the first three s\\xa0 benaiah the son of jehoiada the son of a valiant man of kabzeel who had done mighty deeds he smote the two altarhearths of moab he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow\\xa0 and he slew an egyptian a man of great stature five cubits high and in the egyptians hand was a spear like a weavers beam and he went down to him with a staff and plucked the spear out of the egyptians hand and slew him with his own spear\\xa0 these things did benaiah the son of jehoiada and had a name among the three mighty men\\xa0 behold he was more honourable than the thirty but he attained not to the first three and david set him over his guard s\\xa0 also the mighty men of valour asahel the brother of joab elhanan the son of dodo of bethlehem\\xa0 shammoth the harorite helez the pelonite\\xa0 ira the son of ikkesh the tekoite abiezer the anathothite\\xa0 sibbecai the hushathite ilai the ahohite\\xa0 mahrai the netophathite heled

eliahba the shaalbonite\\xa0 the sons of hashem the gizonite jonathan the son of shageh the hararite\\xa0 ahiam the son of sacar the hararite eliphal the son of ur\\xa0 hepher the mecherathite ahijah the pelonite\\xa0 hezro the carmelite naarai the son of ezbai\\xa0 joel the brother of nathan mibhar the son of hagri\\xa0 zelek the ammonite nahrai the berothite the armourbearer of joab the son of zeruiah\\xa0 ira the ithrite gareb the ithrite\\xa0 uriah the hittite zabad the son of ahlai\\xa0 adina the son of shiza the reubenite a chief of the reubenites and thirty with him\\xa0 hanan the son

and jeribai and joshaviah the sons of elnaam and ithmah the moabite\\xa0 eliel and obed and jaasiel the mezobaite \\xa0 now these are they that came to david to ziklag while he was yet shut up because of saul the son of kish and they were among the mighty men his helpers in war\\xa0 they were armed with bows and could use both the right hand and the left in slinging stones and in shooting arrows from the bow they were of sauls brethren of benjamin\\xa0 the chief was ahiezer then joash the sons of shemaah the gibeathite and jeziel and pelet the sons of azmaveth and beracah and jehu the anathothite\\xa0 and ishmaiah the gibeonite a mighty man among the thirty and over the thirty\\xa0 and jeremiah and jahaziel and johanan and jozabad the gederathite s\\xa0 eluzai and jerimoth and bealiah and shemariah and shephatiah the hariphite\\xa0 elkanah and isshiah and azarel and joezer and jashobeam the korahites\\xa0 and joelah and zebadiah the sons of jeroham of the troop\\xa0 and of the gadites there separated themselves unto david to the stronghold in the wilderness mighty men of valour men trained for war that could handle shield and spear whose faces were like the faces of lions and they were as swift as the roes upon the mountains\\xa0 ezer the chief obadiah the second eliab the third\\xa0 mashmannah the fourth jeremiah the fifth\\xa0 attai the sixth eliel the seventh\\xa0 johanan the eighth elzabad the ninth\\xa0 jeremiah the tenth machbannai the eleventh s\\xa0 these of the sons of gad were captains of the host he that was least was equal to a hundred and the greatest to a thousand\\xa0 these are they that went over the jordan in the first month when it had overflown all its banks and they put to flight all them of the valleys both toward the east and toward the west \\xa0 and there came of the children of benjamin and judah to the stronghold unto david\\xa0 and david went out to meet them and answered and said unto them if ye be come peaceably unto me to help me my heart shall be knit unto you but if ye be come to betray me to mine adversaries seeing there is no wrong in my hands the god of our fathers look thereon and give judgment s\\xa0 then the spirit clothed amasai who was chief of the captains thine are we david and on thy side thou son of jesse peace peace be unto thee and peace be to thy helpers for thy god helpeth thee then david received them and made them captains of the band \\xa0 of manasseh also there fell away some to david when he came with the philistines against saul to battle but they helped them not for the lords of the philistines upon advisement sent him away saying he will fall away to his master saul to the jeopardy of our heads\\xa0 as he went to ziklag there fell to him of manasseh adnah and jozabad and jediael and michael and jozabad and elihu and zillethai captains of thousands that were of manasseh\\xa0 and they helped david against the troop for they were all mighty men of valour and were captains in the host\\xa0 for from day to day men came to david to help him until there was a great host like the host of god \\xa0 and these are the numbers of the heads of them that were armed for war who came to david to hebron to turn the kingdom of saul to him according to the word of the lord s\\xa0 the children of judah that bore shield and spear were six thousand and eight hundred armed for war s\\xa0 of the children of simeon mighty men of valour for the war seven thousand and one hundred s\\xa0 of the children of levi four thousand and six hundred s\\xa0 and jehoiada was the leader of the house of aaron and with him were three thousand and seven hundred s\\xa0 and zadok a young man mighty of valour and of his fathers house twenty and two captains s\\xa0 and of the children of benjamin the brethren of saul three thousand for hitherto the greatest part of them had kept their allegiance to the house of saul s\\xa0 and of the children of ephraim twenty thousand and eight hundred mighty men of valour famous men in their fathers houses s\\xa0 and of the halftribe of manasseh eighteen thousand who were mentioned by name to come and make david king s\\xa0 and of the chil',\n",
       "  'dren of issachar men that had understanding of the times to know what israel ought to do the heads of them were two hundred and all their brethren were at their commandment s\\xa0 of zebulun such as were able to go out in the host that could set the battle in array with all manner of instruments of war fifty thousand and that could order the battle array and were not of double heart s\\xa0 and of naphtali a thousand captains and with them with shield and spear thirty and seven thousand s\\xa0 and of the danites that could set the battle in array twenty and eight thousand and six hundred s\\xa0 and of asher such as were able to go out in the host that could set the battle in array forty thousand s\\xa0 and on the other side of the jordan of the reubenites and the gadites and of the halftribe of manasseh with all manner of instruments of war for the battle a hundred and twenty thousand s\\xa0 all these being men of war that could order the battle array came with a whole heart to hebron to make david king over all israel and all the rest also of israel were of one heart to make david king\\xa0 and they were there with david three days eating and drinking for their brethren had made preparation for them\\xa0 moreover they that were nigh unto them even as far as issachar and zebulun and naphtali brought bread on asses and on camels and on mules and on oxen victual of meal cakes of figs and clusters of raisins and wine and oil and oxen and sheep in abundance for there was joy in israel \\xa0 and david consulted with the captains of thousands and of hundreds even with every leader\\xa0 and david said unto all the assembly of israel if it seem good unto you and if it be of the lord our god let us send abroad everywhere unto our brethren that are left in all the land of israel and with them to the priests and levites that are in their cities that have open land about them that they may gather themselves unto us\\xa0 and let us bring back the ark of our god to us for we sought not unto it in the days of saul\\xa0 and all the assembly said that they would do so for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people\\xa0 so david assembled all israel together from shihor the brook of egypt even unto the entrance of hamath to bring the ark of god from kiriathjearim\\xa0 and david went up and all israel to baalah that is to kiriathjearim which belonged to judah to bring up from thence the ark of god the lord that sitteth upon the cherubim whereon is called the name\\xa0 and they set the ark of god upon a new cart  out of the house of abinadab and uzza and ahio drove the cart\\xa0 and david and all israel played before god with all their might even with songs and with harps and with psalteries and with timbrels and with cymbals and with trumpets\\xa0 and when they came unto the threshingfloor of chidon uzza put forth his hand to hold the ark for the oxen stumbled\\xa0 and the anger of the lord was kindled against uzza and he smote him because he put forth his hand to the ark and there he died before god\\xa0 and david was displeased because the lord had broken forth upon uzza and that place was called perezuzza unto this day\\xa0 and david was afraid of god that day saying how shall i bring the ark of god home to me\\xa0 so david removed not the ark unto him into the city of david but carried it aside into the house of obededom the gittite\\xa0 and the ark of god remained with the family of obededom in his house three months and the lord blessed the house of obededom and all that he had s\\xa0 and huram king of tyre sent messengers to david and cedartrees and masons and carpenters to build him a house\\xa0 and david perceived that the lord had established him king over israel for his kingdom was exalted exceedingly for his people israels sake s\\xa0 and david took more wives at jerusalem and david begot more sons and daughters\\xa0 and these are the names of the children whom he had in jerusalem shammua and shobab nathan and solomon\\xa0 and ibhar and elishua and elpelet\\xa0 and nogah and nepheg and japhia\\xa0 and elishama and beeliada and eliphelet \\xa0 and when the philistines heard that david was anointed king over all israel all the philistines went up to seek david and david heard of it and went out to meet them\\xa0 now the philistines had come and made a raid in the valley of rephaim\\xa0 and david inquired of god saying shall i go up against the philistines and wilt thou deliver them into my hand and the lord said unto him go up for i will deliver them into thy hand\\xa0 so they came up to baalperazim and david smote them there and david said god hath broken mine enemies by my hand like the breach of waters therefore they called the name of that place baalperazim\\xa0 and they left their gods there and david gave commandment and they were burned with fire \\xa0 and the philistines yet again made a raid in the valley\\xa0 and david inquired again of god and god said unto him thou shalt not go up after them turn away from them and come upon them over against the mulberrytrees\\xa0 and it shall be when thou hearest the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberrytrees that then thou shalt go out to battle for god is gone out before thee to smite the host of the philistines\\xa0 and david did as god commanded him and they smote the host of the philistines from gibeon even to gezer\\xa0 and the fame of david went out into all lands and the lord brought the fear of him upon all nations\\xa0 and  made him houses in the city of david and he prepared a place for the ark of god and pitched for it a tent\\xa0 then david said none ought to carry the ark of god but the levites for them hath the lord chosen to carry the ark of the lord and to minister unto him for ever \\xa0 and david assembled all israel at jerusalem to bring up the ark of the lord unto its place which he had prepared for it\\xa0 and david gathered together the sons of aaron and the levites s\\xa0 of the sons of kohath uriel the chief and his brethren a hundred and twenty s\\xa0 of the sons of merari asaiah the chief and his brethren two hundred and twenty s\\xa0 of the sons of gershom joel the chief and his brethren a hundred and thirty s\\xa0 of the sons of elizaphan shemaiah the chief and his brethren two hundred s\\xa0 of the sons of hebron eliel the chief and his brethren fourscore s\\xa0 of the sons of uzziel amminadab the chief and his brethren a hundred and twelve \\xa0 and david called for zadok and abiathar the priests and for the levites for uriel asaiah and joel shemaiah and eliel and amminadab s\\xa0 and said unto them ye are the heads of the fathers houses of the levites sanctify yourselves both ye and your brethren that ye may bring up the ark of the lord the god of israel unto the place that i have prepared for it\\xa0 for because ye  not at the first the lord our god made a breach upon us for that we sought him not according to the ordinance\\xa0 so the priests and the levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of the lord the god of israel\\xa0 and the children of the levites bore the ark of god upon their shoulders with the bars thereon as moses commanded according to the word of the lord \\xa0 and david spoke to the chief of the levites to appoint their brethren the singers with instruments of music psalteries and harps and cymbals sounding aloud and lifting up the voice with joy \\xa0 so the levites appointed heman the son of joel and of his brethren asaph the son of berechiah s and of the sons of merari their brethren ethan the son of kushaiah\\xa0 and with them their brethren of the second degree zechariah ben and jaaziel and shemiramoth and jehiel and unni eliab and benaiah and maaseiah and mattithiah and eliphalehu and mikneiah and obededom and jeiel the doorkeepers\\xa0 so the singers heman asaph and ethan  with cymbals of brass to sound aloud\\xa0 and zechariah and aziel and shemiramoth and jehiel and unni and eliab and maaseiah and benaiah with psalteries set to alamoth\\xa0 and mattithiah and eliphalehu and mikneiahu and obededom and jeiel and azaziah with harps on the sheminith to lead\\xa0 and chenaniah chief of the levites was over the song he was master in the song because he was skilful\\xa0 and berechiah and elkanah were doorkeepers for the ark\\xa0 and shebaniah and joshaphat and nethanel and amasai and zechariah and benaiah and eliezer the priests did blow with the trumpets before the ark of god and obededom and jehiah were doorkeepers for the ark\\xa0 so david and the elders of israel and the captains over thousands went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the lord out of the house of obededom with joy \\xa0 and it came to pass when god helped the levites that bore the ark of the covenant of the lord that they sacrificed seven bullocks and seven rams\\xa0 and david was clothed with a robe of fine linen and all the levites that bore the ark and the singers and chenaniah the master of the singers in the song and david had upon him an ephod of linen\\xa0 thus all israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the lord with shouting and with sound of the horn and with trumpets and with cymbals sounding aloud with psalteries and harps\\xa0 and it came to pass as the ark of the covenant of the lord came to the city of david that michal the daughter of saul looked out at the window and saw king david dancing and making merry and she despised him in her heart \\xa0 and they brought in the ark of god and set it in the midst of the tent that david had pitched for it and they offered burntofferings and peaceofferings before god\\xa0 and when david had made an end of offering the burntoffering and the peaceofferings he blessed the people in the name of the lord\\xa0 and he dealt to every one of israel both man and woman to every one a loaf of bread and a cake made in a pan and a sweet cake\\xa0 and he appointed certain of the levites to minister before the ark of the lord and to celebrate and to thank and praise the lord the god of israel s\\xa0 asaph the chief and second to him zechariah jeiel and shemiramoth and jehiel and mattithiah and eliab and benaiah and obededom and jeiel with psalteries and with harps and asaph with cymbals sounding aloud\\xa0 and benaiah and jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually before the ark of the covenant of god\\xa0 then on that day did david first ordain to give thanks unto the lord by the hand of asaph and his brethren \\xa0 o give thanks unto the lord call upon his name make known his doings among the peoples\\xa0 sing unto him sing praises unto him speak ye of all his marvellous works\\xa0 glory ye in his holy name let the heart of them rejoice that

his servant ye children of jacob his chosen ones\\xa0 he is the lord our god his judgments are in all the earth\\xa0 remember his covenant for ever the word which he commanded to a thousand generations\\xa0  which he made with abraham and his oath unto isaac\\xa0 and he established it unto jacob for a statute to israel for an everlasting covenant\\xa0 saying unto thee will i give the land of canaan the lot of your inheritance\\xa0 when ye were but a few men in number yea very few and sojourners in it\\xa0 and when they went about from nation to nation and from one kingdom to another people\\xa0 he suffered no man to do them wrong yea for their sake he reproved kings\\xa0 touch not mine anointed ones and do my prophets no harm \\xa0 sing unto the lord all the earth proclaim his salvation from day to day\\xa0 declare his glory among the nations his marvellous works among all the peoples\\xa0 for great is the lord and highly to be praised he also is to be feared above all gods\\xa0 for all the gods of the peoples are things of nought but the lord made the heavens\\xa0 honour and majesty are before him strength and gladness are in his place\\xa0 ascribe unto the lord ye kindreds of the peoples ascribe unto the lord glory and strength\\xa0 ascribe unto the lord the glory due unto his name bring an offering and come before him worship the lord in the beauty of holiness\\xa0 tremble before him all the earth the world also is established that it cannot be moved\\xa0 let the heavens be glad and let the earth rejoice and let them say among the nations the lord reigneth\\xa0 let the sea roar and the fulness thereof let the field exult and all that is therein\\xa0 then shall the trees of the wood sing for joy before the lord for he is come to judge the earth\\xa0 o give th',\n",

thanks unto thy holy name that we may triumph in thy praise\\xa0 blessed be the lord the god of israel from everlasting even to everlasting and all the people said amen and praised the lord \\xa0 so he left there before the ark of the covenant of the lord asaph and his brethren to minister before the ark continually as every days work required\\xa0 and obededom with their brethren threescore and eight s obededom also the son of jedithun and hosah to be doorkeepers\\xa0 and zadok the priest and his brethren the priests before the tabernacle of the lord in the high place that was at gibeon\\xa0 to offer burntofferings unto the lord upon the altar of burntoffering continually morning and evening even according to all that is written in the law of the lord which he commanded unto israel\\xa0 and with them heman and jeduthun and the rest that were chosen who were mentioned by name to give thanks to the lord because his mercy endureth for ever\\xa0 and with them heman and jeduthun to sound aloud with trumpets and cymbals and with instruments for the songs of god and the sons of jeduthun to be at the gate\\xa0 and all the people departed every man to his house and david returned to bless his house \\xa0 and it came to pass when david dwelt in his house that david said to nathan the prophet lo i dwell in a house of cedar but the ark of the covenant of the lord dwelleth under curtains\\xa0 and nathan said unto david do all that is in thy heart for god is with thee s\\xa0 and it came to pass the same night that the word of god came to nathan saying\\xa0 go and tell david my servant thus saith the lord thou shalt not build me a house to dwell in\\xa0 for i have not dwelt in a house since the day that i brought up israel unto this day but have  from tent to tent and from one tabernacle \\xa0 in all places wherein i have walked among all israel spoke i a word with any of the judges of israel whom i commanded to feed my people saying why have ye not built me a house of cedar\\xa0 now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant david s thus saith the lord of hosts i took thee from the sheepcote from following the sheep that thou shouldest be prince over my people israel\\xa0 and i have been with thee whithersoever thou wentest and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee and i will make thee a name like unto the name of the great ones that are in the earth\\xa0 and i will appoint a place for my people israel and will plant them that they may dwell in their own place and be disquieted no more neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more as at the first\\xa0 even from the day that i commanded judges to be over my people israel and i will subdue all thine enemies moreover i tell thee that the lord will build thee a house\\xa0 and it shall come to pass when thy days are fulfilled that thou must go to be with thy fathers that i will set up thy seed after thee who shall be of thy sons and i will establish his kingdom\\xa0 he shall build me a house and i will establish his throne for ever\\xa0 i will be to him for a father and he shall be to me for a son and i will not take my mercy away from him as i took it from him that was before thee\\xa0 but i will settle him in my house and in my kingdom for ever and his throne shall be established for ever\\xa0 according to all these words and according to all this vision so did nathan speak unto david \\xa0 then david the king went in and sat before the lord and he said who am i o lord god and what is my house that thou hast brought me thus far\\xa0 and this was a small thing in thine eyes o god but thou hast spoken of thy servants house for a great while to come and hast regarded me after the manner of a man of high degree o lord god\\xa0 what can david say yet more unto thee concerning the honour which is done to thy servant for thou knowest thy servant\\xa0 o lord for thy servants sake and according to thine own heart hast thou wrought all this greatness to make known all these great things\\xa0 o lord there is none like thee neither is there any god beside thee according to all that we have heard with our ears\\xa0 and who is like thy people israel a nation one in the earth whom god went to redeem unto himself for a people to make thee a name by great and tremendous things in driving out nations from before thy people whom thou didst redeem out of egypt\\xa0 for thy people israel didst thou make thine own people for ever and thou lord becamest their god\\xa0 and now o lord let the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant and concerning his house be established for ever and do as thou hast spoken\\xa0 yea let it be established and let thy name be magnified for ever that it may be said the lord of hosts is the god of israel even a god to israel and the house of david thy servant shall be established before thee\\xa0 for thou o my god hast revealed to thy servant that thou wilt build him a house therefore hath thy servant taken heart to pray before thee\\xa0 and now o lord thou alone art god and hast promised this good thing unto thy servant\\xa0 and now it hath pleased thee to bless the house of thy servant that it may continue for ever before thee for thou o lord hast blessed and so let  be blessed for ever \\xa0 and after this it came to pass that david smote the philistines and subdued them and took gath and its towns out of the hand of the philistines\\xa0 and he smote moab and the moabites became servants to david and brought presents\\xa0 and david smote hadarezer king of zobah by hamath as he went to establish his dominion at the river euphrates\\xa0 and david took from him a thousand chariots and seven thousand horsemen and twenty thousand footmen and david houghed all the chariot horses but reserved of them for a hundred chariots\\xa0 and when the arameans of damascus came to succour hadarezer king of zobah david smote of the arameans two and twenty thousand men\\xa0 then david put  in aram damascus and the arameans became servants to david and brought presents and the lord gave victory to david whithersoever he went\\xa0 and david took the shields of gold that were on the servants of hadarezer and brought them to jerusalem\\xa0 and from tibhath and from cun cities of hadarezer david took very much brass wherewith solomon made the brazen sea and the pillars and the vessels of brass \\xa0 and when tou king of hamath heard that david had smitten all the host of hadarezer king of zobah\\xa0 he sent hadoram his son to king david to salute him and to bless himbecause he had fought against hadarezer and smitten him for hadarezer had wars with touand  all manner of vessels of gold and silver and brass\\xa0 these also did king david dedicate unto the lord with the silver and the gold that he carried away from all the nations from edom and from moab and from the children of ammon and from the philistines and from amalek\\xa0 moreover abishai the son of zeruiah smote of the edomites in the valley of salt eighteen thousand\\xa0 and he put garrisons in edom and all the edomites became servants to david and the lord gave victory to david whithersoever he went\\xa0 and david reigned over all israel and he executed justice and righteousness unto all his people\\xa0 and joab the son of zeruiah was over the host and jehoshaphat the son of ahilud was recorder\\xa0 and zadok the son of ahitub and abimelech the son of abiathar were priests and shavsha was scribe\\xa0 and benaiah the son of jehoiada was over the cherethites and the pelethites and the sons of david were chief about the king \\xa0 and it came to pass after this that nahash the king of the children of ammon died and his son reigned in his stead\\xa0 and david said l will show kindness unto hanun the son of nahash because his father showed kindness to me so david sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father and davids servants came into the land of the children of ammon to hanun to comfort him\\xa0 but the princes of the children of ammon said to hanun thinkest thou that david doth honour thy father that he hath sent comforters unto thee are not his servants come unto thee to search and to overthrow and to spy out the land\\xa0 so hanun took davids servants and shaved them and cut off their garments in the middle even to their hips and sent them away\\xa0 then there went certain persons and told david how the men were served and he sent to meet them for the men were greatly ashamed and the king said tarry at jericho until your beards be grown and then return s\\xa0 and when the children of ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to david hanun and the children of ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of aramnaharaim and out of arammaacah and out of zobah\\xa0 so they hired them thirty and two thousand chariots and the king of maacah and his people who came and encamped before medeba s and the children of ammon gathered themselves together from their cities and came to battle s\\xa0 and when david heard of it he sent joab and all the host of the mighty men\\xa0 and the children of ammon came out and put the battle in array at the gate of the city and the kings that were come were by themselves in the field\\xa0 now when joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind he chose of all the choice men of israel and put them in array against the arameans\\xa0 and the rest of the people he committed into the hand of abishai his brother and they put themselves in array against the children of ammon\\xa0 and he said if the arameans be too strong for me then thou shalt help me s but if the children of ammon be too strong for thee then i will help thee\\xa0 be of good courage and let us prove strong for our people and for the cities of our god and the lord do that which seemeth him good\\xa0 so joab and the people that were with him drew nigh unto the battle to meet the arameans and they fled before him\\xa0 and when the children of ammon saw that the arameans were fled they likewise fled before abishai his brother and entered into the city then joab came to jerusalem s\\xa0 and when the arameans saw that they were put to the worse before israel they sent messengers and brought out the arameans that were beyond the river with shophach the captain of the host of hadarezer at their head\\xa0 and it was told david and he gathered all israel together and passed over the jordan and came upon them and set the battle in array against them so when david had put the battle in array against the arameans they fought with him\\xa0 and the arameans fled before israel and david slew of the arameans the men of seven thousand chariots and forty thousand footmen and killed shophach the captain of the host\\xa0 and when the servants of hadarezer saw that they were put to the worse before israel they made peace with david and served him neither would the arameans help the children of ammon any more s\\xa0 and it came to pass at the time of the return of the year at the time when kings go out to battle that joab led forth the power of the army and wasted the country of the children of ammon and came and besieged rabbah but david tarried at jerusalem and joab smote rabbah and overthrew it\\xa0 and david took the crown of malcam from off his head and found it to weigh a talent of gold and there were precious stones in it and it was set upon davids head and he brought forth the spoil of the city exceeding much\\xa0 and he brought forth the people that were therein and cut them with saws and with harrows of iron and with axes and thus did david unto all the cities of the children of ammon and david and all the people returned to jerusalem s\\xa0 and it came to pass after this that there arose war at gezer with the philistines then sibbecai the hushathite slew sippai of the sons of the giants and they were subdued\\xa0 and there was again war with the philistines and elhanan the son of jair slew lahmi the brother of goliath the gittite the staff of whose spear was like a weavers beam s\\xa0 and there was again war at gath where was a man of great stature whose fingers and toes were four and twenty six  and six  and he also was born unto the giant\\xa0 and when he taunted israel jonathan the son of shimea davids brother slew him\\xa0 these were born unto the giant in gath and they fell by the hand of david and by the hand',\n",
       "  ' of his servants \\xa0 and satan stood up against israel and moved david to number israel\\xa0 and david said to joab and to the princes of the people go number israel from beersheba even to dan and bring me word that i may know the sum of them\\xa0 and joab said the lord make his people a hundred times so many more as they are but my lord the king are they not all my lords servants why doth my lord require this thing why will he be a cause of guilt unto israel\\xa0 nevertheless the kings word prevailed against joab wherefore joab departed and went throughout all israel and came to jerusalem\\xa0 and joab gave up the sum of the numbering of the people unto david and all they of israel were a thousand thousand and a hundred thousand men that drew sword and judah was four hundred threescore and ten thousand men that drew sword\\xa0 but levi and benjamin he did not number among them for the kings word was abominable to joab\\xa0 and god was displeased with this thing therefore he smote israel s\\xa0 and david said unto god i have sinned greatly in that i have done this thing but now put away i beseech thee the iniquity of thy servant for i have done very foolishly \\xa0 and the lord spoke unto gad davids seer saying\\xa0 go and speak unto david saying thus saith the lord i offer thee three things choose thee one of them that i may do it unto thee\\xa0 so gad came to david and said unto him thus saith the lord take which thou wilt\\xa0 either three years of famine or three months to be swept away before thy foes while the sword of thine enemies overtaketh thee or else three days the sword of the lord even pestilence in the land and the angel of the lord destroying throughout all the borders of israel now therefore consider what answer i shall return to him that sent me s\\xa0 and david said unto gad i am in a great strait let me fall now into the hand of the lord for very great are his mercies and let me not fall into the hand of man\\xa0 so the lord sent a pestilence upon israel and there fell of israel seventy thousand men\\xa0 and god sent an angel unto jerusalem to destroy it and as he was about to destroy the lord beheld and he repented him of the evil and said to the destroying angel it is enough now stay thy hand and the angel of the lord was standing by the threshingfloor of ornan the jebusite s\\xa0 and david lifted up his eyes and saw the angel of the lord standing between the earth and the heaven having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over jerusalem then david and the elders clothed in sackcloth fell upon their faces\\xa0 and david said unto god is it not i that commanded the people to be numbered even i it is that have sinned and done very wickedly but these sheep what have they done let thy hand i pray thee o lord my god be against me and against my fathers house but not against thy people that they should be plagued s\\xa0 then the angel of the lord commanded gad to say to david that david should go up and rear an altar unto the lord in the threshingfloor of ornan the jebusite\\xa0 and david went up at the saying of gad which he spoke in the name of the lord\\xa0 and ornan turned back and saw the angel and his four sons that were with him hid themselves now ornan was threshing wheat\\xa0 and as david came to ornan ornan looked and saw david and went out of the threshingfloor and bowed down to david with his face to the ground\\xa0 then david said to ornan give me the place of this threshingfloor that i may build thereon an altar unto the lord for the full price shalt thou give it me that the plague may be stayed from the people\\xa0 and ornan said unto david take it to thee and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes lo i give thee the oxen for burntofferings and the threshinginstruments for wood and the wheat for the mealoffering i give it all\\xa0 and king david said to ornan nay but i will verily buy it for the full price for i will not take that which is thine for the lord nor offer a burntoffering without cost\\xa0 so david gave to ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight\\xa0 and david built there an altar unto the lord and offered burntofferings and peaceofferings and called upon the lord and he answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burntoffering s\\xa0 and the lord commanded the angel and he put up his sword back into the sheath thereof\\xa0 at that time when david saw that the lord had answered him in the threshingfloor of ornan the jebusite then he sacrificed there\\xa0 for the tabernacle of the lord which moses made in the wilderness and the altar of burntoffering were at that time in the high place at gibeon\\xa0 but david could not go before it to inquire of god for he was terrified because of the sword of the angel of the lord s\\xa0 then david said this is the house of the lord god and this is the altar of burntoffering for israel \\xa0 and david commanded to gather together the strangers that were in the land of israel and he set masons to hew wrought stones to build the house of god\\xa0 and david prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates and for the couplings and brass in abundance without weight\\xa0 and cedartrees without number for the zidonians and they of tyre brought cedartrees in abundance to david \\xa0 and david said solomon my son is young and tender and the house that is to be builded for the lord must be exceeding magnificent of fame and of glory throughout all countries i will therefore make preparation for him so david prepared abundantly before his death\\xa0 then he called for solomon his son and charged him to build a house for the lord the god of israel s\\xa0 and david said to solomon my son as for me it was in my heart to build a house unto the name of the lord my god\\xa0 but the word of the lord came to me saying thou hast shed blood abundantly and hast made great wars thou shalt not build a house unto my name because thou hast shed much blood upon the earth in my sight\\xa0 behold a son shall be born to thee who shall be a man of rest and i will give him rest from all his enemies round about for his name shall be solomon and i will give peace and quietness unto israel in his days\\xa0 he shall build a house for my name and he shall be to me for a son and i will be to him for a father and i will establish the throne of his kingdom over israel for ever\\xa0 now my son the lord be with thee and prosper thou and build the house of the lord thy god as he hath spoken concerning thee\\xa0 only the lord give thee discretion and understanding and give thee charge concerning israel that so thou mayest keep the law of the lord thy god\\xa0 then shalt thou prosper if thou observe to do the statutes and the ordinances which the lord charged moses with concerning israel be strong and of good courage fear not neither be dismayed\\xa0 now behold in my straits i have prepared for the house of the lord a hundred thousand talents of gold and a thousand thousand talents of silver and of brass and iron without weight for it is in abundance timber also and stone have i prepared and thou mayest add thereto\\xa0 moreover there are workmen with thee in abundance hewers and workers of stone and timber and all men that are skilful in any manner of work\\xa0 of the gold the silver and the brass and the iron there is no number arise and be doing and the lord be with thee\\xa0 david also commanded all the princes of israel to help solomon his son s\\xa0 is not the lord your god with you and hath he not given you rest on every side for he hath delivered the inhabitants of the land into my hand and the land is subdued before the lord and before his people\\xa0 now set your heart and your soul to seek after the lord your god arise therefore and build ye the sanctuary of the lord god to bring the ark of the covenant of the lord and the holy vessels of god into the house that is to be built to the name of the lord \\xa0 now david was old and full of days and he made solomon his son king over israel\\xa0 and he gathered together all the princes of israel with the priests and the levites\\xa0 and the levites were numbered from thirty years old and upward and their number by their polls man by man was thirty and eight thousand\\xa0 of these twenty and four thousand were to oversee the work of the house of the lord and six thousand were officers and judges\\xa0 and four thousand were doorkeepers and four thousand praised the lord with the instruments which i made to praise therewith s\\xa0 and david divided them into courses s according to the sons of levi gershon kohath and merari s\\xa0 of the gershonites ladan and shimei s\\xa0 the sons of ladan jehiel the chief and zetham and joel three s\\xa0 the sons of shimei shelomith and haziel and haran three these were the heads of the fathers houses of ladan s\\xa0 and the sons of shimei jahath zina and jeush and beriah these four were the sons of shimei\\xa0 and jahath was the chief and zizah the second but jeush and beriah had not many sons therefore they became a fathers house in one reckoning s\\xa0 the sons of kohath amram izhar hebron and uzziel four s\\xa0 the sons of amram aaron and moses and aaron was separated that he should be sanctified as most holy he and his sons for ever to offer

and jeremoth three s\\xa0 these were the sons of levi after their fathers houses even the heads of the fathers houses according to their muster in the number of names by their polls who did the work for the service of the house of the lord from twenty years old and upward\\xa0 for david said the lord the god of israel hath given rest unto his people and he dwelleth in jerusalem for ever\\xa0 and also the levites shall no more have need to carry the tabernacle and all the vessels of it for the service thereof\\xa0 for by the last ordinances of david the sons of levi were numbered from twenty years old and upward\\xa0 for their station was at the side of the sons of aaron for the service of the house of the lord in the courts and in the chambers and in the purifying of all holy things even the work of the service of the house of god\\xa0 for the showbread also and for the fine flour for a mealoffering whether of unleavened wafers or of that which is baked on the griddle or of that which

charge of the holy place and the charge of the sons of aaron their brethren for the service of the house of the lord \\xa0 and the courses of the sons of aaron were these the sons of aaron nadab and abihu eleazar and ithamar\\xa0 but nadab and abihu died before their father and had no children therefore eleazar and ithamar executed the priests office\\xa0 and david with zadok of the sons of eleazar and ahimelech of the sons of ithamar divided them according to their ordering in their service\\xa0 and there were more chief men found of the sons of eleazar than of the sons of ithamar and thus were they divided of the sons of eleazar there were sixteen heads of fathers houses and of the sons of ithamar according to their fathers houses eight\\xa0 thus were they divided by lot one sort with another for they were princes of the sanctuary and princes of god both of the sons of eleazar and of the sons of ithamar s\\xa0 and shemaiah the son of nethanel the scribe who was of the levites

and cattle of the king and of his sons with the officers and the mighty men even all the mighty men of valour unto jerusalem\\xa0 then david the king stood up upon his feet and said hear me my brethren and my people as for me it was in my heart to build a house of rest for the ark of the covenant of the lord and for the footstool of our god and i had made ready for the building\\xa0 but god said unto me thou shalt not build a house for my name because thou art a man of war and hast shed blood\\xa0 howbeit the lord the god of israel chose me out of all the house of my father to be king over israel for ever for he hath chosen judah to be prince and in the house of judah the house of my father and among the sons of my father he took pleasure in me to make me king over all israel\\xa0 and of all my sonsfor the lord hath given me many sonshe hath chosen solomon my son to sit upon the throne of the kingdom of the lord over israel\\xa0 and he said unto me solomon thy son he shall build my house and my courts for i have chosen him to be to me for a son and i will be to him for a father\\xa0 and i will establish his kingdom for ever if he be constant to do my commandments and mine ordinances as at this day\\xa0 now therefore in the sight of all israel the congregation of the lord and in the hearing of our god observe and seek out all the commandments of the lord your god that ye may possess this good land and leave it for an inheritance to your children after you for ever\\xa0 and thou solomon my son know thou the god of thy father and serve him with a whole heart and with a willing mind for the lord searcheth all hearts and understandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts if thou seek him he will be found of thee but if thou forsake him he will cast thee off for ever\\xa0 take heed now for the lord hath chosen thee to build a house for the sanctuary be strong and do it \\xa0 then david gave to solomon his son the pattern of the porch  and of the houses thereof and of the treasuries thereof and of the upper rooms thereof and of the inner chambers thereof and of the place of the arkcover\\xa0 and the pattern of all that he had by the spirit for the courts of the house of the lord and for all the chambers round about for the treasuries of the house of god and for the treasuries of the hallowed things\\xa0 also for the courses of the priests and

cherubim that spread out their wings and covered the ark of the covenant of the lord\\xa0 all this  in writing as the lord hath made me wise by his hand upon me even all the works of this pattern \\xa0 and david said to solomon his son be strong and of good courage and do it fear not nor be dismayed for the lord god even my god is with thee he will not fail thee nor forsake thee until all the work for the service of the house of the lord be finished\\xa0 and behold there are the courses of the priests and the levites for all the service of the house of god and there shall be with thee in all manner of work every willing man that hath skill for any manner of service also the captains and all the people will be wholly at thy commandment s\\xa0 and david the king said unto all the congregation solomon my son whom alone god hath chosen is yet young and tender and the work is great for the palace is not for man but for the lord god\\xa0 now i have prepared with all my might for the house of my god the gold for the things of gold and the silver for the things of silver and the brass for the things of brass the iron for the things of iron and wood for the things of wood onyx stones and stones to be set glistering stones and of divers colours and all manner of precious stones and marble stones in abundance\\xa0 moreover also because i have set my affection on the house of my god seeing that i have a treasure of mine own of gold and silver i give it unto the house of my god over and above all that i have prepared for the holy house\\xa0 even three thousand talents of gold of the gold of ophir and seven thousand talents of refined silver wherewith to overlay the walls of the houses\\xa0 of gold for the things of gold and of silver for the things of silver and for all manner of work to be made by the hands of artificers who then offereth willingly to consecrate himself this day unto the lord\\xa0 then the princes of the fathers houses and the princes of the tribes of israel and the captains of thousands and of hundreds with the rulers over the kings work offered willingly\\xa0 and they gave for the service of the house of god of gold five thousand talents and ten thousand darics and of silver ten thousand talents and of brass eighteen thousand talents and of iron a hundred thousand talents\\xa0 and they with whom precious stones were found gave them to the treasure of the house of the lord under the hand of jehiel the gershonite\\xa0 then the people rejoiced for that they offered willingly because with a whole heart they offered willingly to the lord and david the king also rejoiced with great joy \\xa0 wherefore david blessed the lord before all the congregation and david said blessed be thou o lord the god of israel our father for ever and ever\\xa0 thine o lord is the greatness and the power and the glory and the victory and the majesty for all that is in the heaven and in the earth is thine thine is the kingdom o lord and thou art exalted as head above all\\xa0 both riches and honour come of thee and thou rulest over all and in thy hand is power and might and in thy hand it is to make great and to give strength unto all\\xa0 now therefore our god we thank thee and praise thy glorious name\\xa0 but who am i and what is my people that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort for all things come of thee and of thine own have we given thee\\xa0 for we are strangers before thee and sojourners as all our fathers were our days on the earth are as a shadow and there is no abiding\\xa0 o lord our god all this store that we have prepared to build thee a house for thy holy name cometh of thy hand and is all thine own\\xa0 i know also my god that thou triest the heart and hast pleasure in uprightness as for me in the uprightness of my heart i have willingly offered all these things and now have i seen with joy thy people that are present here offer willingly unto thee\\xa0 o lord the god of abraham of isaac and of israel our fathers keep this for ever even the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of thy people and direct their heart unto thee\\xa0 and give unto solomon my son a whole heart to keep thy commandments thy testimonies and thy statutes and to do all these things and to build the palace for which i have made provision \\xa0 and david said to all the congregation now bless the lord your god and all the congregation blessed the lord the god of their fathers and bowed down their heads and prostrated themselves before the lord and before the king\\xa0 and they sacrificed sacrifices unto the lord and offered burntofferings unto the lord on the morrow after that day even a thousand bullocks a thousand rams and a thousand lambs with their drinkofferings and sacrifices in abundance for all israel\\xa0 and did eat and drink before the lord on that day with great gladness and they made solomon the son of david king the second time and anointed him unto the lord to be prince and zadok to be priest\\xa0 then solomon sat on the throne of the lord as king instead of david his father and prospered and all israel hearkened to him\\xa0 and all the princes and the mighty men and all the sons likewise of king david submitted themselves unto solomon the king\\xa0 and the lord magnified solomon exceedingly in the sight of all israel and bestowed upon him such royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in israel \\xa0 now david the son of jesse reigned over all israel\\xa0 and the time that he reigned over israel was forty years seven years reigned he in hebron and thirty and three years reigned he in jerusalem\\xa0 and he died in a good old age full of days riches and honour and solomon his son reigned in his stead\\xa0 now the acts of david the king first and last behold they are written in the words of samuel the seer and in the words of nathan the prophet and in the words of gad the seer\\xa0 with all his reign and his might and the times that went over him and over israel and over all the kingdoms of the countries \\xa0 and solomon the son of david was strengthened in his kingdom and the lord his god was with him and magnified him exceedingly\\xa0 and solomon spoke unto all israel to the captains of thousands and of hundreds and to the judges and to every prince in all israel the heads of the fathers houses\\xa0 so solomon and all the congregation with him went to the high place that was at gibeon for there was the tent of meeting of god which moses the servant of the lord had made in the wilderness\\xa0 but the ark of god had david brought up from kiriathjearim to the place that david had prepared for it for he had pitched a tent for it at jerusalem\\xa0 moreover the brazen altar that bezalel the son of uri the son of hur had made had been put before the tabernacle of the lord and solomon and the congregation sought unto it\\xa0 and solomon offered there upon the brazen altar before the lord which was at the tent of meeting he offered a thousand burntofferings upon it\\xa0 in that night did god appear unto solomon and said unto him ask what i shall give thee\\xa0 and solomon said unto god thou hast shown great kindness unto david my father and hast made me king in his stead\\xa0 now o lord god let thy promise unto david my father be established for thou hast made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in multitude\\xa0 give me now wisdom and knowledge that i may go out and come in before this people for who can judge this thy people that is so great s\\xa0 and god said to solomon because this was in thy heart and thou hast not asked riches wealth or honour nor the life of them that hate thee neither yet hast asked long life but hast asked wisdom and knowledge for thyself that thou mayest judge my people over whom i have made thee king\\xa0 wisdom and knowledge is granted unto thee and i will give thee riches and wealth and honour such as none of the kings have had that have been before thee neither shall there any after thee have the like\\xa0 so ',\n",
       "  'solomon came  to the high place that was at gibeon from before the tent of meeting unto jerusalem and he reigned over israel \\xa0 and solomon gathered chariots and horsemen and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots and twelve thousand horsemen that he placed in the chariot cities and with the king at jerusalem\\xa0 and the king made silver and gold to be in jerusalem as stones and cedars made he to be as the sycamoretrees that are in the lowland for abundance\\xa0 and the horses which solomon had were brought out of egypt also out of keve the kings merchants buying them of the men of keve at a price\\xa0 and they fetched up and brought out of egypt a chariot for six hundred shekels of silver and a horse for a hundred and fifty and so for all the kings of the hittites and the kings of aram did they bring them out by their means\\xa0 now solomon purposed to build a house for the name of the lord and a house for his kingdom\\xa0 and solomon counted out threescore and ten thousand men to bear burdens and fourscore thousand men that were hewers in the mountains and three thousand and six hundred to oversee them \\xa0 and solomon sent to huram the king of tyre saying as thou didst deal with david my father and didst send him cedars to build him a house to dwell therein \\xa0 behold i am about to build a house for the name of the lord my god to dedicate it to him and to burn before him incense of sweet spices and for the continual showbread and for the burntofferings morning and evening on the sabbaths and on the new moons and on the appointed seasons of the lord our god this is an ordinance for ever to israel\\xa0 and the house which i build is great for great is our god above all gods\\xa0 but who is able to build him a house seeing the heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain him who am i then that i should build him a house save only to offer before him\\xa0 now therefore send me a man skilful to work in gold and in silver and in brass and in iron and in purple and crimson and blue and that hath skill to grave all manner of gravings to be with the skilful men that are with me in judah and in jerusalem whom david my father did provide\\xa0 send me also cedartrees cypresstrees and sandalwood out of lebanon for i know that thy servants have skill to cut timber in lebanon and behold my servants shall be with thy servants\\xa0 even to prepare me timber in abundance for the house which i am about to build shall be great and wonderful\\xa0 and behold i will give to thy servants the hewers that cut timber twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat and twenty thousand measures of barley and twenty thousand baths of wine and twenty thousand baths of oil s\\xa0 then huram the king of tyre answered in writing which he sent to solomon because the lord loveth his people he hath made thee king over them\\xa0 huram said moreover blessed be the lord the god of israel that made heaven and earth who hath given to david the king a wise son endued with discretion and understanding that should build a house for the lord and a house for his kingdom\\xa0 and now i have sent a skilful man endued with understanding even huram my master craftsman\\xa0 the son of a woman of the daughters of dan and his father was a man of tyre skilful to work in gold and in silver in brass in iron in stone and in timber in purple in blue and in fine linen and in crimson also to grave any manner of graving and to devise any device to do whatever may be set before him with thy skilful men and with the skilful men of my lord david thy father\\xa0 now therefore the wheat and the barley the oil and the wine which my lord hath spoken of let him send unto his servants\\xa0 and we will cut wood out of lebanon as much as thou shalt need and we will bring it to thee in floats by sea to joppa and thou shalt carry it up to jerusalem \\xa0 and solomon numbered all the strangers that were in the land of israel after the numbering wherewith david his father had numbered them and they were found a hundred and fifty thousand and three thousand and six hundred\\xa0 and he set threescore and ten thousand of them to bear burdens and fourscore thousand to be hewers in the mountains and three thousand and six hundred overseers to set the people at work\\xa0 then solomon began to build the house of the lord at jerusalem in mount moriah where  appeared unto david his father for which provision had been made in the place of david in the threshingfloor of ornan the jebusite\\xa0 and he began to build in the second day of the second month in the fourth year of his reign\\xa0 now these are the foundations which solomon laid for the building of the house of god the length by cubits after the ancient measure was threescore cubits and the breadth twenty cubits\\xa0 and the porch that was before  the length of it according to the breadth of the house was twenty cubits and the height a hundred and twenty and he overlaid it within with pure gold\\xa0 and the greater house he covered with cypresswood which he overlaid with fine gold and wrought thereon palmtrees and chains\\xa0 and he garnished the house with precious stones for beauty and the gold was gold of parvaim\\xa0 he overlaid also the house the beams the thresholds and the walls thereof and the doors thereof with gold and graved cherubim on the walls s\\xa0 and he made the most holy place the length thereof according to the breadth of the house was twenty cubits and the breadth thereof twenty cubits and he overlaid it with fine gold amounting to six hundred talents\\xa0 and the weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold and he overlaid the upper chambers with gold\\xa0 and in the most holy place he made two cherubim of image work and they overlaid them with gold\\xa0 and the wings of the cherubim were twenty cubits long the wing of the one cherub was five cubits reaching to the wall of the house and the other wing was likewise five cubits reaching to the wing of the other cherub\\xa0 and the wing of the other cherub was five cubits reaching to the wall of the house and the other wing was five cubits also joining to the wing of the other cherub\\xa0 the wings of these cherubim spread themselves forth twenty cubits and they stood on their feet and their faces were inward s\\xa0 and he made the veil of blue and purple and crimson and fine linen and wrought cherubim thereon s\\xa0 also he made before the house two pillars of thirty and five cubits high and the capital that was on the top of each of them was five cubits s\\xa0 and he made chains in the sanctuary and put them on the tops of the pillars and he made a hundred pomegranates and put them on the chains\\xa0 and he set up the pillars before the temple one on the right hand and the other on the left and called the name of that on the right hand jachin and the name of that on the left boaz s\\xa0 moreover he made an altar of brass twenty cubits the length thereof and twenty cubits the breadth thereof and ten cubits the height thereof s\\xa0 also he made the molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim round in compass and the height thereof was five cubits and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about\\xa0 and under it was the similitude of oxen which did compass it round about for ten cubits compassing the sea round about the oxen were in two rows cast when it was cast\\xa0 it stood upon twelve oxen three looking toward the north and three looking toward the west and three looking toward the south and three looking toward the east and the sea was set upon them above and all their hinder parts were inward\\xa0 and it was a handbreadth thick and the brim thereof was wrought like the brim of a cup like the flower of a lily it received and held three thousand baths s\\xa0 he made also ten lavers and put five on the right hand and five on the left to wash in them such things as belonged to the burntoffering they washed in them but the sea was for the priests to wash in s\\xa0 and he made the ten candlesticks of gold according to the ordinance concerning them and he set them in the temple five on the right hand and five on the left s\\xa0 he made also ten tables and placed them in the temple five on the right side and five on the left and he made a hundred basins of gold s\\xa0 furthermore he made the court of the priests and the great court and doors for the court and overlaid the doors of them with brass\\xa0 and he set the sea on the right side  eastward toward the south\\xa0 and huram made the pots and the shovels and the basins so huram made an end of doing the work that he wrought for king solomon in the house of god\\xa0 the two pillars and the bowls and the two capitals which were on the top of the pillars and the two networks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars\\xa0 and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks two rows of pomegranates for each network to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were upon the top of the pillars\\xa0 he made also the bases and the lavers made he upon the bases\\xa0 one sea and the twelve oxen under it\\xa0 the pots also and the shovels and the fleshhooks and all the vessels thereof did huram his master craftsman make for king solomon for the house of the lord of bright brass\\xa0 in the plain of the jordan did the king cast them in the clay ground between succoth and zeredah\\xa0 thus solomon made all these vessels in great abundance for the weight of the brass could not be found out s\\xa0 and solomon made all the vessels that were in the house of god the golden altar also and the tables whereon was the showbread\\xa0 and the candlesticks with their lamps that they should burn according to the ordinance before the sanctuary of pure gold\\xa0 and the flowers and the lamps and the tongs of gold and that perfect gold\\xa0 and the snuffers and the basins and the pans and the firepans of pure gold and as for the entry of the house the inner doors thereof for the most holy place and the doors of the house that is of the temple were of gold\\xa0 thus all the work that solomon wrought for the house of the lord was finished s and solomon brought in the things that david his father had hallowed even the silver and the gold and all the vessels and put them in the treasuries of the house of god \\xa0 then solomon assembled the elders of israel and all the heads of the tribes the princes of the fathers houses of the children of israel unto jerusalem to bring up the ark of the covenant of the lord out of the city of david which is zion\\xa0 and all the men of israel assembled themselves unto the king at the feast which was in the seventh month\\xa0 and all the elders of israel came and the levites took up the ark\\xa0 and they brought up the ark and the tent of meeting and all the holy vessels that were in the tent these did the priests and the levites bring up\\xa0 and king solomon and all the congregation of israel that were assembled unto him were before the ark sacrificing sheep and oxen that could not be counted nor numbered for multitude\\xa0 and the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the lord unto its place into the sanctuary of the house to the most holy place even under the wings of the cherubim\\xa0 for the cherubim spread forth their wings over the place of the ark and the cherubim covered the ark and the staves thereof above\\xa0 and the staves were so long that the ends of the staves were seen from the ark before the sanctuary but they could not be seen without and there they are unto this day\\xa0 there was nothing in the ark save the two tables which moses put there at horeb when the lord made a covenant with the children of israel when they came out of egypt \\xa0 and it came to pass when the priests were come out of the holy placefor all the priests that were present had sanctified themselves and did not keep their courses\\xa0 also the levites who were the singers all of them even asaph heman jeduthun and their sons and their brethren arrayed in fine linen with cymbals and psalteries and harps stood at the east end of the altar and with them a hundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets\\xa0 it came even to pass when the trumpeters and singers were as one to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the lord and when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of music and praised the lord for he is good for his mercy endureth for ever that then the house was filled with a cloud even the house of the lord\\xa0 so that the priests',\n",
       "  ' could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud for the glory of the lord filled the house of god \\xa0 then spoke solomon the lord hath said that he would dwell in the thick darkness\\xa0 but i have built thee a house of habitation and a place for thee to dwell in for ever\\xa0 and the king turned his face and blessed all the congregation of israel and all the congregation of israel stood\\xa0 and he said blessed be the lord the god of israel who spoke with his mouth unto david my father and hath with his hands fulfilled it saying\\xa0 since the day that i brought forth my people out of the land of egypt i chose no city out of all the tribes of israel to build a house in that my name might be there neither chose i any man to be prince over my people israel\\xa0 but i have chosen jerusalem that my name might be there and have chosen david to be over my people israel\\xa0 now it was in the heart of david my father to build a house for the name of the lord the god of israel\\xa0 but the lord said unto david my father whereas it was in thy heart to build a house for my name thou didst well that it was in thy heart\\xa0 nevertheless thou shalt not build the house but thy son that shall come forth out of thy loins he shall build the house for my name\\xa0 and the lord hath established his word that he spoke for i am risen up in the room of david my father and sit on the throne of israel as the lord promised and have built the house for the name of the lord the god of israel\\xa0 and there have i set the ark wherein is the covenant of the lord which he made with the children of israel\\xa0 and he stood before the altar of the lord in the presence of all the congregation of israel and spread forth his hands\\xa0 for solomon had made a brazen scaffold of five cubits long and five cubits broad and three cubits high and had set it in the midst of the court and upon it he stood and kneeled down upon his knees before all the congregation of israel and spread forth his hands toward heaven \\xa0 and he said p\\xa0o lord the god of israel there is no god like thee in the heaven or in the earth who keepest covenant and mercy with thy servants that walk before thee with all their heart\\xa0 who hast kept with thy servant david my father that which thou didst promise him yea thou spokest with thy mouth and hast fulfilled it with thy hand as it is this day\\xa0 now therefore o lord the god of israel keep with thy servant david my father that which thou hast promised him saying there shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit on the throne of israel if only thy children take heed to their way to walk in my law as thou hast walked before me\\xa0 now therefore o lord the god of israel let thy word be verified which thou spokest unto thy servant david\\xa0 but will god in very truth dwell with men on the earth behold heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee how much less this house which i have builded\\xa0 yet have thou respect unto the prayer of thy servant and to his supplication o lord my god to hearken unto the cry and to the prayer which thy servant prayeth before thee\\xa0 that thine eyes may be open toward this house day and night even toward the place whereof thou hast said that thou wouldest put thy name there to hearken unto the prayer which thy servant shall pray toward this place\\xa0 and hearken thou to the supplications of thy servant and of thy people israel when they shall pray toward this place yea hear thou from thy dwellingplace even from heaven and when thou hearest forgive\\xa0 if a man sin against his neighbour and an oath be exacted of him to cause him to swear and he come and swear before thine altar in this house\\xa0 then hear thou from heaven and do and judge thy servants requiting the wicked to bring his way upon his own head and justifying the righteous to give him according to his righteousness s\\xa0 and if thy people israel be smitten down before the enemy when they sin against thee and shall turn again and confess thy name and pray and make supplication before thee in this house\\xa0 then hear thou from heaven and forgive the sin of thy people israel and bring them back unto the land which thou gavest to them and to their fathers \\xa0 when the heaven is shut up and there is no rain when they sin against thee if they pray toward this place and confess thy name turning from their sin when thou dost afflict them\\xa0 then hear thou in heaven and forgive the sin of thy servants and of thy people israel when thou dost direct them on the good way wherein they should walk and send rain upon thy land which thou hast given to thy people for an inheritance s\\xa0 if there be in the land famine if there be pestilence if there be blasting or mildew locust or caterpillar if their enemies besiege them in the land of their cities whatsoever plague or whatsoever sickness there be\\xa0 what prayer and supplication soever be made by any man or by all thy people israel who shall know every man his own plague and his own pain and shall spread forth his hands toward this house\\xa0 then hear thou from heaven thy dwellingplace and forgive and render unto every man according to all his ways whose heart thou knowestfor thou even thou only knowest the hearts of the children of men\\xa0 that they may fear thee to walk in thy ways all the days that they live in the land which thou gavest unto our fathers s\\xa0 moreover concerning the stranger that is not of thy people israel when he shall come out of a far country for thy great names sake and thy mighty hand and thine outstretched arm when they shall come and pray toward this house\\xa0 then hear thou from heaven even from thy dwellingplace and do according to all that the stranger calleth to thee for that all the peoples of the earth may know thy name and fear thee as doth thy people israel and that they may know that thy name is called upon this house which i have built\\xa0 if thy people go out to battle against their enemies by whatsoever way thou shalt send them and they pray unto thee toward this city which thou hast chosen and the house which i have built for thy name\\xa0 then hear thou from heaven their prayer and their supplication and maintain their cause\\xa0 if they sin against theefor there is no man that sinneth notand thou be angry with them and deliver them to the enemy so that they carry them away captive unto a land far off or near\\xa0 yet if they shall bethink themselves in the land whither they are carried captive and turn and make supplication unto thee in the land of their captivity saying we have sinned we have done iniquitously and have dealt wickedly\\xa0 if they return unto thee with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their captivity whither they have carried them captive and pray toward their land which thou gavest unto their fathers and the city which thou hast chosen and toward the house which i have built for thy name\\xa0 then hear thou from heaven even from thy dwellingplace their prayer and their supplications and maintain their cause and forgive thy people who have sinned against thee\\xa0 now o my god let i beseech thee thine eyes be open and let thine ears be attent unto the prayer that is made in this place s\\xa0 now therefore arise o lord god into thy restingplace thou and the ark of thy strength let thy priests o lord god be clothed with salvation and let thy saints rejoice in good\\xa0 o lord god turn not away the face of thine anointed remember the good deeds of david thy servant \\xa0 now when solomon had made an end of praying the fire came down from heaven and consumed the burntoffering and the sacrifices and the glory of the lord filled the house\\xa0 and the priests could not enter into the house of the lord because the glory of the lord filled the lords house\\xa0 and all the children of israel looked on when the fire came down and the glory of the lord was upon the house and they bowed themselves with their faces to the ground upon the pavement and prostrated themselves and gave thanks unto the lord for he is good for his mercy endureth for ever\\xa0 and the king and all the people offered sacrifice before the lord s\\xa0 and king solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty and two thousand oxen and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep so the king and all the people dedicated the house of god\\xa0 and the priests stood according to their offices the levites also with instruments of music of the lord which david the king had made to give thanks unto the lord for his mercy endureth for ever with the praises of david by their hand and the priests sounded trumpets over against them and all israel stood s\\xa0 moreover solomon hallowed the middle of the court that was before the house of the lord for there he offered the burntofferings and the fat of the peaceofferings because the brazen altar which solomon had made was not able to receive the burntoffering and the mealoffering and the fat\\xa0 so solomon held the feast at that time seven days and all israel with him a very great congregation from the entrance of hamath unto the brook of egypt\\xa0 and on the eighth day they held a solemn assembly for they kept the dedication of the altar seven days and the feast seven days\\xa0 and on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent the people away unto their tents joyful and glad of heart for the goodness that the lord had shown unto david and to solomon and to israel his people\\xa0 thus solomon finished the house of the lord and the kings house and all that came into solomons heart to make in the house of the lord and in his own house he prosperously effected \\xa0 and the lord appeared to solomon by night and said unto him i have heard thy prayer and have chosen this place to myself for a house of sacrifice\\xa0 if i shut up heaven that there be no rain or if i command the locust to devour the land or if i send pestilence among my people\\xa0 if my people upon whom my name is called shall humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their evil ways then will i hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their land\\xa0 now mine eyes shall be open and mine ears attent unto the prayer that is made in this place\\xa0 for now have i chosen and hallowed this house that my name may be there for ever and mine eyes and my heart shall be there perpetually\\xa0 and as for thee if thou wilt walk before me as david thy father walked and do according to all that i have commanded thee and wilt keep my statutes and mine ordinances\\xa0 then i will establish the throne of thy kingdom according as i covenanted with david thy father saying there shall not fail thee a man to be ruler in israel\\xa0 but if ye turn away and forsake my statutes and my commandments which i have set before you and shall go and serve other gods and worship them\\xa0 then will i pluck them up by the roots out of my land which i have given them and this house which i have hallowed for my name will i cast out of my sight and i will make it a proverb and a byword among all peoples\\xa0 and this house which is so high every one that passeth by it shall be astonished and shall say why hath the lord done thus unto this land and to this house\\xa0 and they shall answer because they forsook the lord the god of their fathers who brought them forth out of the land of egypt and laid hold on other gods and worshipped them and served them therefore hath he brought all this evil upon them \\xa0 and it came to pass at the end of twenty years wherein solomon had built the house of the lord and his own house\\xa0 that the cities which huram had given to solomon solomon built them and caused the children of israel to dwell there\\xa0 and solomon went to hamathzobah and prevailed against it\\xa0 and he built tadmor in the wilderness and all the storecities which he built in hamath\\xa0 also he built bethhoron the upper and bethhoron the nether fortified cities with walls gates and bars\\xa0 and baalath and all the storecities that solomon had and all the cities for his chariots and the cities for his horsemen and all that solomon desired to build for his pleasure in jerusalem and in lebanon and in all the land of his dominion\\xa0 as for all the people that were left of the hittites and the amorites and the perizzites and the hivites and the jebusites who were not of israel\\xa0 of their children that were left after them in the land whom the children of israel consumed not of them did solomon raise a levy of bondservants unt',\n",
       "  'o this day\\xa0 but of the children of israel did solomon make no servants for his work but they were men of war and chief of his captains and rulers of his chariots and of his horsemen \\xa0 and these were the chief officers of king solomon even two hundred and fifty that bore rule over the people\\xa0 and solomon brought up the daughter of pharaoh out of the city of david unto the house that he had built for her for he said no wife of mine shall dwell in the house of david king of israel because the places are holy whereunto the ark of the lord hath come \\xa0 then solomon offered burntofferings unto the lord on the altar of the lord which he had built before the porch\\xa0 even as the duty of every day required offering according to the commandment of moses on the sabbaths and on the new moons and on the appointed seasons three times in the year even in the feast of unleavened bread and in the feast of weeks and in the feast of tabernacles\\xa0 and he appointed according to the ordinance of david his father the courses of the priests to their service and the levites to their charges to praise and to minister before the priests as the duty of every day required the doorkeepers also by their courses at every gate for so had david the man of god commanded\\xa0 and they departed not from the commandment of the king unto the priests and levites concerning any matter or concerning the treasures\\xa0 so all the work of solomon was set in order from the day of the foundation of the house of the lord and until it was finished so the house of the lord was perfected s\\xa0 then went solomon to eziongeber and to eloth on the seashore in the land of edom\\xa0 and huram sent him by the hands of his servants ships and servants that had knowledge of the sea and they came with the servants of solomon to ophir and fetched from thence four hundred and fifty talents of gold and brought them to king solomon \\xa0 and when the queen of sheba heard of the fame of solomon she came to prove solomon with hard questions at jerusalem with a very great train and camels that bore spices and gold in abundance and precious stones and when she was come to solomon she spoke with him of all that was in her heart\\xa0 and solomon told her all her questions and there was not any thing hid from solomon which he told her not\\xa0 and when the queen of sheba had seen the wisdom of solomon and the house that he had built\\xa0 and the food of his table and the sitting of his servants and the attendance of his ministers and their apparel his cupbearers also and their apparel and his ascent by which he went up into the house of the lord there was no more spirit in her\\xa0 and she said to the king it was a true report that i heard in mine own land of thine acts and of thy wisdom\\xa0 howbeit i believed not their words until i came and mine eyes had seen it and behold the half of the greatness of thy wisdom was not told me thou exceedest the fame that i heard\\xa0 happy are thy men and happy are these thy servants that stand continually before thee and hear thy wisdom\\xa0 blessed be the lord thy god who delighted in thee to set thee on his throne to be king for the lord thy god because thy god loved israel to establish them for ever therefore made he thee king over them to do justice and righteousness\\xa0 and she gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold and spices in great abundance and precious stones neither was there any such spice as the queen of sheba gave to king solomon\\xa0 and the servants also of huram and the servants of solomon that brought gold from ophir brought sandalwood and precious stones\\xa0 and the king made of the sandalwood paths for the house of the lord and for the kings house and harps and psalteries for the singers and there were none such seen before in the land of judah\\xa0 and king solomon gave to the queen of sheba all her desire whatsoever she asked beside that which she had brought unto the king so she turned and went to her own land she and her servants \\xa0 now the weight of gold that came to solomon in one year was six hundred and threescore and six talents of gold\\xa0 beside that which the traffickers and merchants brought and all the kings of arabia and the governors of the country brought gold and silver to solomon\\xa0 and king solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold six hundred shekels of beaten gold went to one target\\xa0 three hundred shields of beaten gold also three hundred shekels of gold went to one shield and the king put them in the house of the forest of lebanon\\xa0 moreover the king made a great throne of ivory and overlaid it with pure gold\\xa0 and there were six steps to the throne with a footstool of gold which were fastened to the throne and arms on either side by the place of the seat and two lions standing beside the arms\\xa0 and twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps there was not the like made in any kingdom\\xa0 and all king solomons drinkingvessels were of gold and all the vessels of the house of the forest of lebanon were of pure gold silver was nothing accounted of in the days of solomon\\xa0 for the king had ships that went to tarshish with the servants of huram once every three years came the ships of tarshish bringing gold and silver ivory and apes and peacocks \\xa0 so king solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom\\xa0 and all the kings of the earth sought the presence of solomon to hear his wisdom which god had put in his heart\\xa0 and they brought every man his present vessels of silver and vessels of gold and raiment armour and spices horses and mules a rate year by year s\\xa0 and solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots and twelve thousand horsemen that he bestowed in the chariot cities and with the king at jerusalem\\xa0 and he ruled over all the kings from the river even unto the land of the philistines and to the border of egypt\\xa0 and the king made silver to be in jerusalem as stones and cedars made he to be as the sycamoretrees that are in the lowland for abundance\\xa0 and they brought horses for solomon out of egypt and out of all lands\\xa0 now the rest of the acts of solomon first and last are they not written in the words of nathan the prophet and in the prophecy of ahijah the shilonite and in the visions of jedo the seer concerning jeroboam the son of nebat\\xa0 and solomon reigned in jerusalem over all israel forty years\\xa0 and solomon slept with his fathers they buried him in the city of david his father and rehoboam his son reigned in his stead \\xa0 and rehoboam went to shechem for all israel were come to shechem to make him king\\xa0 and it came to pass when jeroboam the son of nebat heard of itfor he was in egypt whither he had fled from the presence of king solomonthat jeroboam returned out of egypt\\xa0 and they sent and called him and jeroboam and all israel came and they spoke to rehoboam saying\\xa0 thy father made our yoke grievous now therefore make thou the grievous service of thy father and his heavy yoke which he put upon us lighter and we will serve thee\\xa0 and he said unto them come again unto me after three days and the people departed s\\xa0 and king rehoboam took counsel with the old men that had stood before solomon his father while he yet lived saying what counsel give ye me to return answer to this people\\xa0 and they spoke unto him saying if thou be kind to this people and please them and speak good words to them then they will be thy servants for ever\\xa0 but he forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given him and took counsel with the young men that were grown up with him that stood before him\\xa0 and he said unto them what counsel give ye that we may return answer to this people who have spoken to me saying make the yoke that thy father did put upon us lighter\\xa0 and the young men that were grown up with him spoke unto him saying thus shalt thou say unto the people that spoke unto thee saying thy father made our yoke heavy but make thou it lighter unto us thus shalt thou say unto them my little finger is thicker than my fathers loins\\xa0 and now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke i will add to your yoke my father chastised you with whips but i will chastise you with scorpions \\xa0 so jeroboam and all the people came to rehoboam the third day as the king bade saying come to me again the third day\\xa0 and the king answered them roughly and king rehoboam forsook the counsel of the old men\\xa0 and spoke to them after the counsel of the young men saying  made your yoke heavy but i will add thereto my father chastised you with whips but i will chastise you with scorpions\\xa0 so the king hearkened not unto the people for it was brought about of god that the lord might establish his word which he spoke by the hand of ahijah the shilonite to jeroboam the son of nebat\\xa0 and when all israel  that the king hearkened not unto them the people answered the king saying what portion have we in david neither have we inheritance in the son of jesse every man to your tents o israel now see to thine own house david so all israel departed unto their tents s\\xa0 but as for the children of israel that dwelt in the cities of judah rehoboam reigned over them\\xa0 then king rehoboam sent hadoram who was over the levy and the children of israel stoned him with stones so that he died s and king rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot to flee to jerusalem s\\xa0 so israel rebelled against the house of david unto this day\\xa0 and when rehoboam was come to jerusalem he assembled the house of judah and benjamin a hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men that were warriors to fight against israel to bring the kingdom back to rehoboam \\xa0 but the word of the lord came to shemaiah the man of god saying\\xa0 speak unto rehoboam the son of solomon king of judah and to all israel in judah and benjamin saying\\xa0 thus saith the lord ye shall not go up nor fight against your brethren return every man to his house for this thing is of me so they hearkened unto the words of the lord and returned from going against jeroboam \\xa0 and rehoboam dwelt in jerusalem and built cities for defence in judah\\xa0 he built even bethlehem and etam and tekoa\\xa0 and bethzur and soco and adullam\\xa0 and gath and mareshah and ziph\\xa0 and adoraim and lachish and azekah\\xa0 and zorah and aijalon and hebron which are in judah and in benjamin fortified cities\\xa0 and he fortified the strongholds and put captains in them and store of victual and oil and wine\\xa0 and in every city he put shields and spears and made them exceeding strong and judah and benjamin adhered to him s\\xa0 and the priests and the levites that were in all israel presented themselves to him out of all their border\\xa0 for the levites left their open land and their possession and came to judah and jerusalem for jeroboam and his sons cast them off that they should not execute the priests office unto the lord\\xa0 and he appointed him priests for the high places and for the satyrs and for the calves which he had made\\xa0 and after them out of all the tribes of israel such as set their hearts to seek the lord the god of israel came to jerusalem to sacrifice unto the lord the god of their fathers\\xa0 so they strengthened the kingdom of judah and made rehoboam the son of solomon strong three years for they walked three years in the way of david and solomon\\xa0 and rehoboam took him a wife mahalath the daughter of jerimoth the son of david and of abihail the daughter of eliab the son of jesse\\xa0 and she bore him sons jeush and shemariah and zaham\\xa0 and after her he took maacah the daughter of absalom and she bore him abijah and attai and ziza and shelomith\\xa0 and rehoboam loved maacah the daughter of absalom above all his wives and his concubinesfor he took eighteen wives and threescore concubines and begot twenty and eight sons and threescore daughters\\xa0 and rehoboam appointed abijah the son of maacah to be chief even the prince among his brethren for he was minded to make him king\\xa0 and he dealt wisely and dispersed of all his sons throughout all the lands of judah and benjamin unto every fortified city and he gave them victual in abundance and he sought for them many wives\\xa0 and it came to pass when the kingdom of rehoboam was established and he was strong that he forsook the law of the lord and all israel with him \\xa0 and it came to pass in the fifth year of king rehoboam that shishak king of egypt ',\n",
       "  'came up against jerusalem because they had dealt treacherously with the lord\\xa0 with twelve hundred chariots and threescore thousand horsemen and the people were without number that came with him out of egypt the lubim the sukkiim and the ethiopians\\xa0 and he took the fortified cities which pertained to judah and came unto jerusalem s\\xa0 now shemaiah the prophet came to rehoboam and to the princes of judah that were gathered together to jerusalem because of shishak and said unto them thus saith the lord ye have forsaken me therefore have i also left you in the hand of shishak\\xa0 then the princes of israel and the king humbled themselves and they said the lord is righteous\\xa0 and when the lord saw that they humbled themselves the word of the lord came to shemaiah saying they have humbled themselves i will not destroy them but i will grant them some deliverance and my wrath shall not be poured out upon jerusalem by the hand of shishak\\xa0 nevertheless they shall be his servants that they may know my service and the service of the kingdoms of the countries s\\xa0 so shishak king of egypt came up against jerusalem and took away the treasures of the house of the lord and the treasures of the kings house he took all away he took away also the shields of gold which solomon had made\\xa0 and king rehoboam made in their stead shields of brass and committed them to the hands of the captains of the guard that kept the door of the kings house\\xa0 and it was so that as oft as the king entered into the house of the lord the guard came and bore them and brought them back into the guardchamber\\xa0 and when he humbled himself the anger of the lord turned from him that he would not destroy him altogether and moreover in judah there were good things found s\\xa0 so king rehoboam strengthened himself in jerusalem and reigned for rehoboam was forty and one years old when he began to reign and he reigned seventeen years in jerusalem the city which the lord had chosen out of all the tribes of israel to put his name there and his mothers name was naamah the ammonitess\\xa0 and he did that which was evil because he set not his heart to seek the lord s\\xa0 now the acts of rehoboam first and last are they not written in the histories of shemaiah the prophet and of iddo the seer after the manner of genealogies and there were wars between rehoboam and jeroboam continually\\xa0 and rehoboam slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of david and abijah his son reigned in his stead \\xa0 in the eighteenth year of king jeroboam began abijah to reign over judah\\xa0 three years reigned he in jerusalem and his mothers name was micaiah the daughter of uriel of gibeah and there was war between abijah and jeroboam\\xa0 and abijah joined battle with an army of valiant men of war even four hundred thousand chosen men s and jeroboam set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men who were mighty men of valour s\\xa0 and abijah stood up upon mount zemaraim which is in the hillcountry of ephraim and said hear me o jeroboam and all israel\\xa0 ought ye not to know that the lord the god of israel gave the kingdom over israel to david for ever even to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt \\xa0 yet jeroboam the son of nebat the servant of solomon the son of david rose up and rebelled against his lord\\xa0 and there were gathered unto him vain men base fellows that strengthened themselves against rehoboam the son of solomon when rehoboam was young and fainthearted and could not withstand them\\xa0 and now ye think to withstand the kingdom of the lord in the hand of the sons of david and ye are a great multitude and there are with you the golden calves which jeroboam made you for gods\\xa0 have ye not driven out the priests of the lord the sons of aaron and the levites and have made you priests after the manner of the peoples of other lands so that whosoever cometh to consecrate himself with a young bullock and seven rams the same becometh a priest of them that are no gods s\\xa0 but as for us the lord is our god and we have not forsaken him and we have priests ministering unto the lord the sons of aaron and the levites in their work\\xa0 and they burn unto the lord every morning and every evening burntofferings and sweet incense the showbread also set they in order upon the pure table and the candlestick of gold with the lamps thereof to burn every evening for we keep the charge of the lord our god but ye have forsaken him\\xa0 and behold god is with us at our head and his priests with the trumpets of alarm to sound an alarm against you o children of israel fight ye not against the lord the god of your fathers for ye shall not prosper\\xa0 but jeroboam caused an ambushment to come about behind them so they were before judah and the ambushment was behind them\\xa0 and when judah looked back behold the battle was before and behind them and they cried unto the lord and the priests sounded with the trumpets\\xa0 then the men of judah gave a shout and as the men of judah shouted it came to pass that god smote jeroboam and all israel before abijah and judah\\xa0 and the children of israel fled before judah and god delivered them into their hand\\xa0 and abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter so there fell down slain of israel five hundred thousand chosen men\\xa0 thus the children of israel were brought under at that time and the children of judah prevailed because they relied upon the lord the god of their fathers\\xa0 and abijah pursued after jeroboam and took cities from him bethel with the towns thereof and jeshanah with the towns thereof and ephrain with the towns thereof\\xa0 neither did jeroboam recover strength again in the days of abijah and the lord smote him and he died \\xa0 but abijah waxed mighty and took unto himself fourteen wives and begot twenty and two sons and sixteen daughters\\xa0 and the rest of the acts of abijah and his ways and his sayings are written in the commentary of the prophet iddo\\xa0 so abijah slept with his fathers and they buried him in the city of david and asa his son reigned in his stead in his days the land was quiet ten years \\xa0 and asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of the lord his god\\xa0 for he took away the strange altars and the high places and broke down the pillars and hewed down the asherim\\xa0 and commanded judah to seek the lord the god of their fathers and to do the law and the commandment\\xa0 also he took away out of all the cities of judah the high places and the sunimages and the kingdom was quiet before him\\xa0 and he built fortified cities in judah for the land was quiet and he had no war in those years because the lord had given him rest\\xa0 for he said unto judah let us build these cities and make about them walls and towers gates and bars the land is yet before us because we have sought the lord our god we have sought him and he hath given us rest on every side so they built and prospered \\xa0 and asa had an army that bore bucklers and spears out of judah three hundred thousand s and out of benjamin that bore shields and drew bows two hundred and fourscore thousand all these were mighty men of valour\\xa0 and there came out against them zerah the ethiopian with an army of a thousand thousand and three hundred chariots and he came unto mareshah\\xa0 then asa went out to meet him and they set the battle in array in the valley of zephath at mareshah\\xa0 and asa cried unto the lord his god and said lord there is none beside thee to help between the mighty and him that hath no strength help us o lord our god for we rely on thee and in thy name are we come against this multitude thou art the lord our god let not man prevail against thee s\\xa0 so the lord smote the ethiopians before asa and before judah and the ethiopians fled\\xa0 and asa and the people that were with him pursued them unto gerar and there fell of the ethiopians so that none remained alive for they were shattered before the lord and before his host and they carried away very much booty\\xa0 and they smote all the cities round about gerar for a terror from the lord came upon them and they spoiled all the cities for there was much spoil in them\\xa0 they smote also the tents of cattle and carried away sheep in abundance and camels and returned to jerusalem s\\xa0 and the spirit of god came upon azariah the son of oded\\xa0 and he went out to meet asa and said unto him hear ye me asa and all judah and benjamin the lord is with you while ye are with him and if ye seek him he will be found of you but if ye forsake him he will forsake you s\\xa0 now for long seasons israel was without the true god and without a teaching priest and without law\\xa0 but when in their distress they turned unto the lord the god of israel and sought him he was found of them\\xa0 and in those times there was no peace to him that went out nor to him that came in but great discomfitures were upon all the inhabitants of the lands\\xa0 and they were broken in pieces nation against nation and city against city for god did discomfit them with all manner of adversity\\xa0 but be ye strong and let not your hands be slack for your work shall be rewarded s\\xa0 and when asa heard these words even the prophecy of oded the prophet he took courage and put away the detestable things out of all the land of judah and benjamin and out of the cities which he had taken from the hillcountry of ephraim and he renewed the altar of the lord that was before the porch of the lord\\xa0 and he gathered all judah and benjamin and them that sojourned with them out of ephraim and manasseh and out of simeon for they fell to him out of israel in abundance when they saw that the lord his god was with him \\xa0 so they gathered themselves together at jerusalem in the third month in the fifteenth year of the reign of asa\\xa0 and they sacrificed unto the lord in that day of the spoil which they had brought seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep\\xa0 and they entered into the covenant to seek the lord the god of their fathers with all their heart and with all their soul\\xa0 and that whosoever would not seek the lord the god of israel should be put to death whether small or great whether man or woman\\xa0 and they swore unto the lord with a loud voice and with shouting and with trumpets and with horns\\xa0 and all judah rejoiced at the oath for they had sworn with all their heart and sought him with their whole desire and he was found of them and the lord gave them rest round about\\xa0 and also maacah the mother of asa the king he removed her from being queen because she had made an abominable image for an asherah and asa cut down her image and made dust of it and burnt it at the brook kidron\\xa0 but the high places were not taken away out of israel nevertheless the heart of asa was whole all his days\\xa0 and he brought into the house of god the things that his father had hallowed and that he himself had hallowed silver and gold and vessels\\xa0 and there was no more war unto the five and thirtieth year of the reign of asa \\xa0 in the six and thirtieth year of the reign of asa baasa king of israel went up against judah and built ramah that he might not suffer any to go out or come in to asa king of judah\\xa0 then asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the house of the lord and of the kings house and sent to benhadad king of aram that dwelt at damascus saying\\xa0 there is a league between me and thee as there was between my father and thy father behold i have sent thee silver and gold go break thy league with baasa king of israel that he may depart from me\\xa0 and benhadad hearkened unto king asa and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of israel and they smote ijon and dan and abelmaim and all the storecities of naphtali\\xa0 and it came to pass when baasa heard thereof that he left off building ramah and let his work cease s\\xa0 then asa the king took all judah and they carried away the stones of ramah and the timber thereof wherewith baasa had builded and he built therewith geba and mizpah s\\xa0 and at that time hanani the seer came to asa king of judah and said unto him because thou hast relied on the king of aram and hast not relied on the lord thy god therefore is the host of the king of aram escaped out of thy hand\\xa0 were not the ethiopians and the lubim a huge host with chariots and horsemen exceeding many yet because thou didst rely on the lord he delivered them into thy hand\\xa0 for t',\n",
       "  'he eyes of the lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth to show himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is whole toward him herein thou hast done foolishly for from henceforth thou shalt have wars\\xa0 then asa was wroth with the seer and put him in the prisonhouse for he was in a rage with him because of this thing and asa oppressed some of the people the same time\\xa0 and behold the acts of asa first and last lo they are written in the book of the kings of judah and israel\\xa0 and in the thirty and ninth year of his reign asa was diseased in his feet his disease was exceeding great yet in his disease he sought not to the lord but to the physicians\\xa0 and asa slept with his fathers and died in the one and fortieth year of his reign\\xa0 and they buried him in his own sepulchres which he had hewn out for himself in the city of david and laid him in the bed which was filled with sweet odours and divers kinds  prepared by the perfumers art and they made a very great burning for him \\xa0 and jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead and strengthened himself against israel\\xa0 and he placed forces in all the fortified cities of judah and set garrisons in the land of judah and in the cities of ephraim which asa his father had taken\\xa0 and the lord was with jehoshaphat because he walked in the first ways of his father david and sought not unto the baalim\\xa0 but sought to the god of his father and walked in his commandments and not after the doings of israel\\xa0 therefore the lord established the kingdom in his hand and all judah brought to jehoshaphat presents and he had riches and honour in abundance\\xa0 and his heart was lifted up in the ways of the lord and furthermore he took away the high places and the asherim out of judah \\xa0 also in the third year of his reign he sent his princes even benhail and obadiah and zechariah and nethanel and micaiah to teach in the cities of judah\\xa0 and with them the levites even shemaiah and nethaniah and zebadiah and asahel and shemiramoth and jehonathan and adonijah and tobijah and tobadonijah the levites and with them elishama and jehoram the priests\\xa0 and they taught in judah having the book of the law of the lord with them and they went about throughout all the cities of judah and taught among the people\\xa0 and a terror from the lord fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands that were round about judah so that they made no war against jehoshaphat\\xa0 and some of the philistines brought jehoshaphat presents and silver for tribute the arabians also brought him flocks seven thousand and seven hundred rams and seven thousand and seven hundred hegoats \\xa0 and jehoshaphat waxed great exceedingly and he built in judah castles and cities of store\\xa0 and he had many works in the cities of judah and men of war mighty men of valour in jerusalem\\xa0 and this was the numbering of them according to their fathers houses of judah the captains of thousands s adnah the captain and with him mighty men of valour three hundred thousand s\\xa0 and next to him jehohanan the captain and with him two hundred and fourscore thousand s\\xa0 and next to him amasiah the son of zichri who willingly offered himself unto the lord and with him two hundred thousand mighty men of valour s\\xa0 and of benjamin eliada a mighty man of valour and with him two hundred thousand armed with bow and shield s\\xa0 and next to him jehozabad and with him a hundred and fourscore thousand ready prepared for war s\\xa0 these were they that waited on the king beside those whom the king put in the fortified cities throughout all judah \\xa0 now jehoshaphat had riches and honour in abundance and he allied himself with ahab by marriage\\xa0 and after a lapse of years he went down to ahab to samaria and ahab killed sheep and oxen for him in abundance and for the people that were with him and persuaded him to go up with him to ramothgilead\\xa0 and ahab king of israel said unto jehoshaphat king of judah wilt thou go with me to ramothgilead and he answered him i am as thou art and my people as thy people and we will be with thee in the war\\xa0 and jehoshaphat said unto the king of israel inquire i pray thee at the word of the lord today\\xa0 then the king of israel gathered the prophets together four hundred men and said unto them shall we go to ramothgilead to battle or shall i forbear and they said go up for god will deliver it into the hand of the king\\xa0 but jehoshaphat said is there not here besides a prophet of the lord that we might inquire of him\\xa0 and the king of israel said unto jehoshaphat there is yet one man by whom we may inquire of the lord but i hate him for he never prophesieth good concerning me but always evil the same is micaiah the son of imla and jehoshaphat said let not the king say so\\xa0 then the king of israel called an officer and said fetch quickly micaiah the son of imla\\xa0 now the king of israel and jehoshaphat the king of judah sat each on his throne arrayed in their robes and they sat in a threshingfloor at the entrance of the gate of samaria and all the prophets were prophesying before them\\xa0 and zedekiah the son of chenaanah made him horns of iron and said thus saith the lord with these shalt thou gore the arameans until they be consumed\\xa0 and all the prophets prophesied so saying go up to ramothgilead and prosper for the lord will deliver it into the hand of the king\\xa0 and the messenger that went to call micaiah spoke to him saying behold the words of the prophets declare good to the king with one mouth let thy word therefore i pray thee be like one of theirs and speak thou good\\xa0 and micaiah said as the lord liveth what my god saith that will i speak\\xa0 and when he was come to the king the king said unto him micaiah shall we go to ramothgilead to battle or shall i forbear and he said go ye up and prosper and they shall be delivered into your hand\\xa0 and the king said to him how many times shall i adjure thee that thou speak unto me nothing but the truth in the name of the lord\\xa0 and he said i saw all israel scattered upon the mountains as sheep that have no shepherd and the lord said these have no master let them return every man to his house in peace\\xa0 and the king of israel said to jehoshaphat did i not tell thee that he would not prophesy good concerning me but evil s\\xa0 and he said therefore hear ye the word of the lord i saw the lord sitting upon his throne and all the host of heaven standing on his right hand and on his left\\xa0 and the lord said who shall entice ahab king of israel that he may go up and fall at ramothgilead and one spoke saying after this manner and another saying after that manner\\xa0 and there came forth the spirit and stood before the lord and said i will entice him and the lord said unto him wherewith\\xa0 and he said i will go forth and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets and he said thou shalt entice him and shalt prevail also go forth and do so\\xa0 now therefore behold the lord hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of these thy prophets and the lord hath spoken evil concerning thee s\\xa0 then zedekiah the son of chenaanah came near and smote micaiah upon the cheek and said which way went the spirit of the lord from me to speak unto thee\\xa0 and micaiah said behold thou shalt see on that day when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself\\xa0 and the king of israel said take ye micaiah and carry him back unto amon the governor of the city and to joash the kings son\\xa0 and say thus saith the king put this fellow in the prison and feed him with scant bread and with scant water until i return in peace\\xa0 and micaiah said if thou return at all in peace the lord hath not spoken by me and he said hear ye peoples all of you\\xa0 so the king of israel and jehoshaphat the king of judah went up to ramothgilead\\xa0 and the king of israel said unto jehoshaphat i will disguise myself and go into the battle but put thou on thy robes so the king of israel disguised himself and they went into the battle\\xa0 now the king of aram had commanded the captains of his chariots saying fight neither with small nor great save only with the king of israel\\xa0 and it came to pass when the captains of the chariots saw jehoshaphat that they said it is the king of israel therefore they turned about to fight against him but jehoshaphat cried out and the lord helped him and god moved them to depart from him\\xa0 and it came to pass when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of israel that they turned back from pursuing him\\xa0 and a certain man drew his bow at a venture and smote the king of israel between the lower armour and the breastplate wherefore he said to the driver of the chariot turn thy hand and carry me out of the host for i am sore wounded\\xa0 and the battle increased that day howbeit the king of israel stayed himself up in his chariot against the arameans until the even and about the time of the going down of the sun he died\\xa0 and jehoshaphat the king of judah returned to his house in peace to jerusalem s\\xa0 and jehu the son of hanani the seer went out to meet him and said to king jehoshaphat shouldest thou help the wicked and love them that hate the lord for this thing wrath is upon thee from before the lord\\xa0 nevertheless there are good things found in thee in that thou hast put away the asheroth out of the land and hast set thy heart to seek god\\xa0 and jehoshaphat dwelt at jerusalem and he went out again among the people from beersheba to the hillcountry of ephraim and brought them back unto the lord the god of their fathers\\xa0 and he set judges in the land throughout all the fortified cities of judah city by city\\xa0 and said to the judges consider what ye do for ye judge not for man but for the lord and  with you in giving judgment\\xa0 now therefore let the fear of the lord be upon you take heed and do it for there is no iniquity with the lord our god nor respect of persons nor taking of bribes\\xa0 moreover in jerusalem did jehoshaphat set of the levites and the priests and of the heads of the fathers houses of israel for the judgment of the lord and for controversies and they returned to jerusalem\\xa0 and he charged them saying thus shall ye do in the fear of the lord faithfully and with a whole heart\\xa0 and whensoever any controversy shall come to you from your brethren that dwell in their cities between blood and blood between law and commandment statutes and ordinances ye shall warn them that they be not guilty towards the lord and so wrath come upon you and upon your brethren thus shall ye do and ye shall not be guilty\\xa0 and behold amariah the chief priest is over you in all matters of the lord and zebadiah the son of ishmael the ruler of the house of judah in all the kings matters also the officers of the levites before you deal courageously and the lord be with the good \\xa0 and it came to pass after this that the children of moab and the children of ammon and with them some of the ammonites came against jehoshaphat to battle\\xa0 then there came some that told jehoshaphat saying there cometh a great multitude against thee from beyond the sea from aram and behold they are in hazazontamarthe same is engedi\\xa0 and jehoshaphat feared and set himself to seek unto the lord and he proclaimed a fast throughout all judah\\xa0 and judah gathered themselves together to seek help of the lord even out of all the cities of judah they came to seek the lord\\xa0 and jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of judah and jerusalem in the house of the lord before the new court\\xa0 and he said o lord the god of our fathers art not thou alone god in heaven and art not thou ruler over all the kingdoms of the nations and in thy hand is power and might so that none is able to withstand thee\\xa0 didst not thou o our god drive out the inhabitants of this land before thy people israel and gavest it to the seed of abraham thy friend for ever\\xa0 and they dwelt therein and have built thee a sanctuary therein for thy name saying\\xa0 if evil come upon us the sword judgment or pestilence or famine we will stand before this house and before theefor thy name is in this houseand cry unto thee in our affliction and thou wilt hear and save\\xa0 and now behold the children of ammon and moab and mount seir whom thou wouldest not let israel invade when they came out of the land of egypt but they turned aside from them and destroyed them not\\xa0 behold they render unto us  to come to cast',\n",
       "  ' us out of thy possession which thou hast given us to inherit\\xa0 o our god wilt thou not execute judgment on them for we have no might against this great multitude that cometh against us neither know we what to do but our eyes are upon thee\\xa0 and all judah stood before the lord with their little ones their wives and their children s\\xa0 then upon jahaziel the son of zechariah the son of benaiah the son of jeiel the son of mattaniah the levite of the sons of asaph came the spirit of the lord in the midst of the congregation\\xa0 and he said hearken ye all judah and ye inhabitants of jerusalem and thou king jehoshaphat thus saith the lord unto you fear not ye neither be dismayed by reason of this great multitude for the battle is not yours but gods\\xa0 tomorrow go ye down against them behold they come up by the ascent of ziz and ye shall find them at the end of the valley before the wilderness of jeruel\\xa0 ye shall not need to fight in this battle set yourselves stand ye still and see the salvation of the lord with you o judah and jerusalem fear not nor be dismayed tomorrow go out against them for the lord is with you\\xa0 and jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground and all judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem fell down before the lord worshipping the lord\\xa0 and the levites of the children of the kohathites and of the children of the korahites stood up to praise the lord the god of israel with an exceeding loud voice\\xa0 and they rose early in the morning and went forth into the wilderness of tekoa and as they went forth jehoshaphat stood and said hear me o judah and ye inhabitants of jerusalem believe in the lord your god so shall ye be established believe his prophets so shall ye prosper\\xa0 and when he had taken counsel with the people he appointed them that should sing unto the lord and praise in the beauty of holiness as they went out before the army and say give thanks unto the lord for his mercy endureth for ever\\xa0 and when they began to sing and to praise the lord set liersinwait against the children of ammon moab and mount seir that were come against judah and they were smitten\\xa0 for the children of ammon and moab stood up against the inhabitants of mount seir utterly to slay and destroy them and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of seir every one helped to destroy another\\xa0 and when judah came to the watchtower of the wilderness they looked upon the multitude and behold they were dead bodies fallen to the earth and there were none that escaped\\xa0 and when jehoshaphat and his people came to take the spoil of them they found among them in abundance both riches and dead bodies and precious jewels which they stripped off for themselves more than they could carry away and they were three days in taking the spoil it was so much\\xa0 and on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of beracah for there they blessed the lord therefore the name of that place was called the valley of beracah unto this day\\xa0 then they returned every man of judah and jerusalem and jehoshaphat in the forefront of them to go back to jerusalem with joy for the lord had made them to rejoice over their enemies\\xa0 and they came to jerusalem with psalteries and harps and trumpets unto the house of the lord\\xa0 and a terror from god was on all the kingdoms of the countries when they heard that the lord fought against the enemies of israel\\xa0 so the realm of jehoshaphat was quiet for his god gave him rest round about \\xa0 and jehoshaphat reigned over judah he was thirty and five years old when he began to reign and he reigned twenty and five years in jerusalem and his mothers name was azubah the daughter of shilhi\\xa0 and he walked in the way of asa his father and turned not aside from it doing that which was right in the eyes of the lord\\xa0 howbeit the high places were not taken away neither as yet had the people set their hearts unto the god of their fathers\\xa0 now the rest of the acts of jehoshaphat first and last behold they are written in the words of jehu the son of hanani which is inserted in the book of the kings of israel\\xa0 and after this did jehoshaphat king of judah join himself with ahaziah king of israel the same did very wickedly\\xa0 and he joined him with himself to make ships to go to tarshish and they made the ships in eziongeber\\xa0 then eliezer the son of dodavahu of mareshah prophesied against jehoshaphat saying because thou hast joined thyself with ahaziah the lord hath made a breach in thy works and the ships were broken that they were not able to go to tarshish\\xa0 and jehoshaphat slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of david and jehoram his son reigned in his stead\\xa0 and he had brethren the sons of jehoshaphat azariah and jehiel and zechariah and azariahu and michael and shephatiah all these were the sons of jehoshaphat king of israel\\xa0 and their father gave them great gifts of silver and of gold and of precious things with fortified cities in judah but the kingdom gave he to jehoram because he was the firstborn \\xa0 now when jehoram was risen up over the kingdom of his father and had strengthened himself he slew all his brethren with the sword and divers also of the princes of israel\\xa0 jehoram was thirty and two years old when he began to reign and he reigned eight years in jerusalem\\xa0 and he walked in the way of the kings of israel as did the house of ahab for he had the daughter of ahab to wife and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord\\xa0 howbeit the lord would not destroy the house of david because of the covenant that he had made with david and as he promised to give a lamp to him and to his children alway\\xa0 in his days edom revolted from under the hand of judah and made a king over themselves\\xa0 then jehoram passed over with his captains and all his chariots with him and he rose up by night and smote the edomites that compassed him about and the captains of the chariots\\xa0 so edom revolted from under the hand of judah unto this day then did libnah revolt at the same time from under his hand because he had forsaken the lord the god of his fathers\\xa0 moreover he made high places in the mountains of judah and made the inhabitants of jerusalem to go astray and drew judah away \\xa0 and there came a writing to him from elijah the prophet saying thus saith the lord the god of david thy father because thou hast not walked in the ways of jehoshaphat thy father nor in the ways of asa king of judah\\xa0 but hast walked in the way of the kings of israel and hast made judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem to go astray like as the house of ahab made  to go astray and also hast slain thy brethren of thy fathers house who were better than thyself\\xa0 behold the lord will smite with a great plague thy people and thy children and thy wives and all thy substance\\xa0 and thou shalt have great sickness by disease of thy bowels until thy bowels fall out by reason of the sickness day by day\\xa0 and the lord stirred up against jehoram the spirit of the philistines and of the arabians that are beside the ethiopians\\xa0 and they came up against judah and broke into it and carried away all the substance that was found in the kings house and his sons also and his wives so that there was never a son left him save jehoahaz the youngest of his sons\\xa0 and after all this the lord smote him in his bowels with an incurable disease\\xa0 and it came to pass that in process of time at the end of two years his bowels fell out by reason of his sickness and he died of sore diseases and his people made no burning for him like the burning of his fathers\\xa0 thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign and he reigned in jerusalem eight years and he departed joyless and they buried him in the city of david but not in the sepulchres of the kings\\xa0 and the inhabitants of jerusalem made ahaziah his youngest son king in his stead for the band of men that came with the arabians to the camp had slain all the eldest so ahaziah the son of jehoram king of judah reigned \\xa0 forty and two years old was ahaziah when he began to reign and he reigned one year in jerusalem and his mothers name was athaliah the daughter of omri\\xa0 he also walked in the ways of the house of ahab for his mother was his counsellor to do wickedly\\xa0 and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord as did the house of ahab for they were his counsellors after the death of his father to his destruction\\xa0 he walked also after their counsel and went with jehoram the son of ahab king of israel to war against hazael king of aram at ramothgilead and the arameans wounded joram\\xa0 and he returned to be healed in jezreel of the wounds which they had given him at ramah when he fought against hazael king of aram and azariah the son of jehoram king of judah went down to see jehoram the son of ahab in jezreel because he was sick\\xa0 now the downfall of ahaziah was of god in that he went unto joram for when he was come he went out with jehoram against jehu the son of nimshi whom the lord had anointed to cut off the house of ahab\\xa0 and it came to pass when jehu was executing judgment upon the house of ahab that he found the princes of judah and the sons of the brethren of ahaziah ministering to ahaziah and slew them\\xa0 and he sought ahaziah and they caught himnow he was hiding in samariaand they brought him to jehu and slew him and they buried him for they said he is the son of jehoshaphat who sought the lord with all his heart and there was none of the house of ahaziah that had power to hold the kingdom\\xa0 now when athaliah the mother of ahaziah saw that her son was dead she arose and destroyed all the seed royal of the house of judah\\xa0 but jehoshabeath the daughter of the king took joash the son of ahaziah and stole him away from among the kings sons that were slain and put him and his nurse in the bedchamber so jehoshabeath the daughter of king jehoram the wife of jehoiada the priestfor she was the sister of ahaziahhid him from athaliah so that she slew him not\\xa0 and he was with them hid in the house of god six years and athaliah reigned over the land \\xa0 and in the seventh year jehoiada strengthened himself and took the captains of hundreds azariah the son of jeroham and ishmael the son of jehohanan and azariah the son of obed and maaseiah the son of adaiah and elishaphat the son of zichri into covenant with him\\xa0 and they went about in judah and gathered the levites out of all the cities of judah and the heads of fathers houses of israel and they came to jerusalem\\xa0 and all the congregation made a covenant with the king in the house of god and he said unto them behold the kings son shall reign as the lord hath spoken concerning the sons of david\\xa0 this is the thing that ye shall do a third part of you that come in on the sabbath of the priests and of the levites shall be porters of the doors\\xa0 and a third part shall be at the kings house and a third part at the gate of the foundation and all the people shall be in the courts of the house of the lord\\xa0 but let none come into the house of the lord save the priests and they that minister of the levites they shall come in for they are holy but all the people shall keep the charge of the lord\\xa0 and the levites shall compass the king round about every man with his weapons in his hand and whosoever cometh into the house let him be slain and be ye with the king when he cometh in and when he goeth out\\xa0 so the levites and all judah did according to all that jehoiada the priest commanded and they took every man his men those that were to come in on the sabbath with those that were to go out on the sabbath for jehoiada the priest dismissed not the courses\\xa0 and jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of hundreds the spears and bucklers and shields that had been king davids which were in the house of god\\xa0 and he set all the people every man with his weapon in his hand from the right side of the house to the left side of the house along by the altar and the house by the king round about\\xa0 then they brought out the kings son and put upon him the crown and the insignia and made him king and jehoiada and his sons anointed him and they said long live the king s\\xa0 and when athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the king she came to the people into the house of the lord\\xa0 and she looked and behold t',\n",
       "  'he king stood on his platform at the entrance and the captains and the trumpets by the king and all the people of the land rejoiced and blew with trumpets the singers also  on instruments of music and led the singing of praise then athaliah rent her clothes and said treason treason s\\xa0 and jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds that were set over the host and said unto them have her forth between the ranks and whoso followeth her let him be slain with the sword for the priest said slay her not in the house of the lord\\xa0 so they made way for her and she went to the entry of the horse gate to the kings house and they slew her there \\xa0 and jehoiada made a covenant between himself and all the people and the king that they should be the lords people\\xa0 and all the people went to the house of baal and broke it down and broke his altars and his images in pieces and slew mattan the priest of baal before the altars\\xa0 and jehoiada appointed the offices of the house of the lord under the hand of the priests the levites whom david had distributed in the house of the lord to offer the burntofferings of the lord as it is written in the law of moses with rejoicing and with singing according to the direction of david\\xa0 and he set the porters at the gates of the house of the lord that none that was unclean in any thing should enter in\\xa0 and he took the captains of hundreds and the nobles and the governors of the people and all the people of the land and brought down the king from the house of the lord and they came through the upper gate unto the kings house and set the king upon the throne of the kingdom\\xa0 so all the people of the land rejoiced and the city was quiet and they slew athaliah with the sword\\xa0 joash was seven years old when he began to reign and he reigned forty years in jerusalem and his mothers name was zibiah of beersheba\\xa0 and joash did that which was right in the eyes of the lord all the days of jehoiada the priest s\\xa0 and jehoiada took for him two wives and he begot sons and daughters\\xa0 and it came to pass after this that joash was minded to restore the house of the lord\\xa0 and he gathered together the priests and the levites and said to them go out unto the cities of judah and gather of all israel money to repair the house of your god from year to year and see that ye hasten the matter howbeit the levites hastened it not\\xa0 and the king called for jehoiada the chief and unto him why hast thou not required of the levites to bring in out of judah and out of jerusalem the tax of moses the servant of the lord and of the congregation of israel for the tent of the testimony\\xa0 for the sons of athaliah that wicked woman had broken up the house of god and also all the hallowed things of the house of the lord did they bestow upon the baalim\\xa0 so the king commanded and they made a chest and set it without at the gate of the house of the lord\\xa0 and they made a proclamation through judah and jerusalem to bring in for the lord the tax that moses the servant of god laid upon israel in the wilderness\\xa0 and all the princes and all the people rejoiced and brought in and cast into the chest until they had made an end\\xa0 and it was so that at what time the chest was brought unto the kings officers by the hand of the levites and when they saw that there was much money the kings scribe and the chief priests officer came and emptied the chest and took it and carried it back to its place thus they did day by day and gathered money in abundance\\xa0 and the king and jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the service of the house of the lord and they hired masons and carpenters to restore the house of the lord and also such as wrought iron and brass to repair the house of the lord\\xa0 so the workmen wrought and the work was perfected by them and they set up the house of god in its state and strengthened it\\xa0 and when they had made an end they brought the rest of the money before the king and jehoiada whereof were made vessels for the house of the lord even vessels wherewith to minister and buckets and pans and vessels of gold and silver and they offered burntofferings in the house of the lord continually all the days of jehoiada \\xa0 but jehoiada waxed old and was full of days and he died a hundred and thirty years old was he when he died\\xa0 and they buried him in the city of david among the kings because he had done good in israel and toward god and his house \\xa0 now after the death of jehoiada came the princes of judah and prostrated themselves before the king then the king hearkened unto them\\xa0 and they forsook the house of the lord the god of their fathers and served the asherim and the idols and wrath came upon judah and jerusalem for this their guiltiness\\xa0 yet he sent prophets to them to bring them back unto the lord and they admonished them but they would not give ear s\\xa0 and the spirit of god clothed zechariah the son of jehoiada the priest and he stood above the people and said unto them thus saith god why transgress ye the commandments of the lord that ye cannot prosper because ye have forsaken the lord he hath also forsaken you\\xa0 and they conspired against him and stoned him with stones at the commandment of the king in the court of the house of the lord\\xa0 thus joash the king remembered not the kindness which jehoiada his father had done to him but slew his son and when he died he said the lord look upon it and require it \\xa0 and it came to pass when the year was come about that the army of the arameans came up against him and they came to judah and jerusalem and destroyed all the princes of the people from among the people and sent all the spoil of them unto the king of damascus\\xa0 for the army of the arameans came with a small company of men and the lord delivered a very great host into their hand because they had forsaken the lord the god of their fathers so they executed judgment upon joash\\xa0 and when they were departed from himfor they left him in great diseaseshis own servants conspired against him for the blood of the sons of jehoiada the priest and slew him on his bed and he died and they buried him in the city of david but they buried him not in the sepulchres of the kings\\xa0 and these are they that conspired against him zabad the son of shimeath the ammonitess and jehozabad the son of shimrith the moabitess\\xa0 now concerning his sons and the multitude of the burdens against him and the rebuilding of the house of god behold they are written in the commentary of the book of the kings and amaziah his son reigned in his stead \\xa0 amaziah was twenty and five years old when he began to reign and he reigned twenty and nine years in jerusalem and his mothers name was jehoaddan of jerusalem\\xa0 and he did that which was right in the eyes of the lord but not with a whole heart\\xa0 now it came to pass when the kingdom was established unto him that he slew his servants who had killed the king his father\\xa0 but he put not their children to death but did according to that which is written in the law in the book of moses as the lord commanded saying the fathers shall not die for the children neither shall the children die for the fathers but every man shall die for his own sin\\xa0 moreover amaziah gathered judah together and ordered them according to their fathers houses under captains of thousands and captains of hundreds even all judah and benjamin and he numbered them from twenty years old and upward and found them three hundred thousand chosen men able to go forth to war that could handle spear and shield\\xa0 he hired also a hundred thousand mighty men of valour out of israel for a hundred talents of silver\\xa0 but there came a man of god to him saying o king let not the army of israel go with thee for the lord is not with israel even with all the children of ephraim\\xa0 but if thou wilt go and do engage never so valiantly in battle god will cast thee down before the enemy for god hath power to help and to cast down\\xa0 and amaziah said to the man of god but what shall we do for the hundred talents which i have given to the army of israel and the man of god answered the lord is able to give thee much more than this\\xa0 then amaziah separated them to wit the army that was come to him out of ephraim to go back home wherefore their anger was greatly kindled against judah and they returned home in fierce anger s\\xa0 and amaziah took courage and led forth his people and went to the valley of salt and smote of the children of seir ten thousand\\xa0 and other ten thousand did the children of judah carry away alive and brought them unto the top of the rock and cast them down from the top of the rock that they all were broken in pieces\\xa0 but the men of the army whom amaziah sent back that they should not go with him to battle fell upon the cities of judah from samaria even unto bethhoron and smote of them three thousand and took much spoil \\xa0 now it came to pass after that amaziah was come from the slaughter of the edomites that he brought the gods of the children of seir and set them up to be his gods and prostrated himself before them and offered unto them\\xa0 wherefore the anger of the lord was kindled against amaziah and he sent unto him a prophet who said unto him why hast thou sought after the gods of the people which have not delivered their own people out of thy hand\\xa0 and it came to pass as he talked with him that  said unto him have we made thee of the kings counsel forbear why shouldest thou be smitten then the prophet forbore and said i know that god hath determined to destroy thee because thou hast done this and hast not hearkened unto my counsel \\xa0 then amaziah king of judah took advice and sent to joash the son of jehoahaz the son of jehu king of israel saying come let us look one another in the face\\xa0 and joash king of israel sent to amaziah king of judah saying the thistle that was in lebanon sent to the cedar that was in lebanon saying give thy daughter to my son to wife and there passed by the wild beasts that were in lebanon and trod down the thistle\\xa0 thou sayestlo thou hast smitten edom will thy heart therefore lift thee up to glory therein abide now at home why shouldest thou meddle with evil that thou shouldest fall even thou and judah with thee\\xa0 but amaziah would not hear for it was of god that he might deliver them into the hand  because they had sought after the gods of edom\\xa0 so joash king of israel went up and he and amaziah king of judah looked one another in the face at bethshemesh which belongeth to judah\\xa0 and judah was put to the worse before israel and they fled every man to his tent\\xa0 and joash king of israel took amaziah king of judah the son of joash the son of jehoahaz at bethshemesh and brought him to jerusalem and broke down the wall of jerusalem from the gate of ephraim unto the corner gate four hundred cubits\\xa0 and  all the gold and silver and all the vessels that were found in the house of god with obededom and the treasures of the kings house the hostages also and returned to samaria \\xa0 and amaziah the son of joash king of judah lived after the death of joash son of jehoahaz king of israel fifteen years\\xa0 now the rest of the acts of amaziah first and last behold are they not written in the book of the kings of judah and israel\\xa0 now from the time that amaziah did turn away from following the lord they made a conspiracy against him in jerusalem and he fled to lachish but they sent after him to lachish and slew him there\\xa0 and they brought him upon horses and buried him with his fathers in the city of judah\\xa0 and all the people of judah took uzziah who was sixteen years old and made him king in the room of his father amaziah\\xa0 he built eloth and restored it to judah after that the king slept with his fathers \\xa0 sixteen years old was uzziah when he began to reign and he reigned fifty and two years in jerusalem and his mothers name was jecoliah of jerusalem\\xa0 and he did that which was right in the eyes of the lord according to all that his father amaziah had done\\xa0 and he set himself to seek god in the days of zechariah who had understanding in the vision of god and as long as he sought the lord god made him to prosper\\xa0 and he went forth and warred against the philistines and broke down the wall of gath and the wall of jabneh and the wall of ashdod and he built cities in  ashdod and among the ',\n",
       "  'philistines\\xa0 and god helped him against the philistines and against the arabians that dwelt in gurbaal and the meunim\\xa0 and the ammonites gave gifts to uzziah and his name spread abroad even to the entrance of egypt for he waxed exceeding strong\\xa0 moreover uzziah built towers in jerusalem at the corner gate and at the valley gate and at the turning and fortified them\\xa0 and be built towers in the wilderness and hewed out many cisterns for he had much cattle in the lowland also and in the tableland and he had husbandmen and vinedressers in the mountains and in the fruitful fields for he loved husbandry s\\xa0 moreover uzziah had an army of fighting men that went out to war by bands according to the number of their reckoning made by jeiel the scribe and maaseiah the officer under the hand of hananiah one of the kings captains\\xa0 the whole number of the heads of fathers houses even the mighty men of valour was two thousand and six hundred\\xa0 and under their hand was a trained army three hundred thousand and seven thousand and five hundred that made war with mighty power to help the king against the enemy\\xa0 and uzziah prepared for them even for all the host shields and spears and helmets and coats of mail and bows and stones for slinging\\xa0 and he made in jerusalem engines invented by skilful men to be on the towers and upon the corners wherewith to shoot arrows and great stones and his name spread far abroad for he was marvellously helped till he was strong\\xa0 but when he was strong his heart was lifted up so that he did corruptly and he trespassed against the lord his god for he went into the temple of the lord to burn incense upon the altar of incense\\xa0 and azariah the priest went in after him and with him fourscore priests of the lord that were valiant men\\xa0 and they withstood uzziah the king and said unto him it pertaineth not unto thee uzziah to burn incense unto the lord but to the priests the sons of aaron that are consecrated it pertaineth to burn incense go out of the sanctuary for thou hast trespassed neither shall it be for thy honour from the lord god\\xa0 then uzziah was wroth and he had a censer in his hand to burn incense and while he was wroth with the priests the leprosy broke forth in his forehead before the priests in the house of the lord beside the altar of incense\\xa0 and azariah the chief priest and all the priests looked upon him and behold he was leprous in his forehead and they thrust him out quickly from thence yea himself made haste also to go out because the lord had smitten him\\xa0 and uzziah the king was a leper unto the day of his death and dwelt in a house set apart being a leper for he was cut off from the house of the lord and jotham his son was over the kings house judging the people of the land\\xa0 now the rest of the acts of uzziah first and last did isaiah the prophet the son of amoz write\\xa0 so uzziah slept with his fathers and they buried him with his fathers in the field of burial which belonged to the kings for they said he is a leper and jotham his son reigned in his stead \\xa0 jotham was twenty and five years old when he began to reign and he reigned sixteen years in jerusalem and his mothers name was jerushah the daughter of zadok\\xa0 and he did that which was right in the eyes of the lord according to all that his father uzziah had done howbeit he entered not into the temple of the lord and the people did yet corruptly\\xa0 he built the upper gate of the house of the lord and on the wall of ophel he built much\\xa0 moreover he built cities in the hillcountry of judah and in the forest he built castles and towers\\xa0 he fought also with the king of the children of ammon and prevailed against them and the children of ammon gave him the same year a hundred talents of silver and ten thousand measures of wheat and ten thousand of barley so much did the children of ammon render unto him in the second year also and in the third\\xa0 so jotham became mighty because he ordered his ways before the lord his god\\xa0 now the rest of the acts of jotham and all his wars and his ways behold they are written in the book of the kings of israel and judah\\xa0 he was five and twenty years old when he began to reign and reigned sixteen years in jerusalem\\xa0 and jotham slept with his fathers and they buried him in the city of david and ahaz his son reigned in his stead \\xa0 ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign and he reigned sixteen years in jerusalem and he did not that which was right in the eyes of the lord like david his father\\xa0 but he walked in the ways of the kings of israel and made also molten images for the baalim\\xa0 moreover he offered in the valley of the son of hinnom and burnt his children in the fire according to the abominations of the heathen whom the lord cast out before the children of israel\\xa0 and he sacrificed and offered in the high places and on the hills and under every leafy tree\\xa0 wherefore the lord his god delivered him into the hand of the king of aram and they smote him and carried away of his a great multitude of captives and brought them to damascus and he was also delivered into the hand of the king of israel who smote him with a great slaughter s\\xa0 for pekah the son of remaliah slew in judah a hundred and twenty thousand in one day all of them valiant men because they had forsaken the lord the god of their fathers\\xa0 and zichri a mighty man of ephraim slew maaseiah the kings son and azrikam the ruler of the house and elkanah that was next to the king s\\xa0 and the children of israel carried away captive of their brethren two hundred thousand women sons and daughters and took also away much spoil from them and brought the spoil to samaria s\\xa0 but a prophet of the lord was there whose name was oded and he went out to meet the host that came to samaria and said unto them behold because the lord the god of your fathers was wroth with judah he hath delivered them into your hand and ye have slain them in a rage which hath reached up unto heaven\\xa0 and now ye purpose to bring the children of judah and jerusalem into subjection for bondmen and bondwomen unto you but are there not even with you acts of guilt of your own against the lord your god\\xa0 now hear me therefore and send back the captives that ye have taken captive of your brethren for the fierce wrath of the lord is upon you s\\xa0 then certain of the heads of the children of ephraim azariah the son of jehohanan berechiah the son of meshillemoth and jehizkiah the son of shallum and amasa the son of hadlai stood up against them that came from the war\\xa0 and said unto them ye shall not bring in the captives hither for ye purpose that which will bring upon us guilt against the lord to add unto our sins and to our guilt for our guilt is great and there is fierce wrath against israel s\\xa0 so the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the princes and all the congregation\\xa0 and the men that have been mentioned by name rose up and took the captives and with the spoil clothed all that were naked among them and arrayed them and shod them and gave them to eat and to drink and anointed them and carried all the feeble of them upon asses and brought them to jericho the city of palmtrees unto their brethren then they returned to samaria \\xa0 at that time did king ahaz send unto the kings of assyria to help him\\xa0 for again the edomites had come and smitten judah and carried away captives\\xa0 the philistines also had invaded the cities of the lowland and of the south of judah and had taken bethshemesh and aijalon and gederoth and soco with the towns thereof and timnah with the towns thereof gimzo also and the towns thereof and they dwelt there\\xa0 for the lord brought judah low because of ahaz king of israel for he had cast away restraint in judah and acted treacherously against the lord\\xa0 and tillegathpilneser king of assyria came unto him and distressed him but strengthened him not\\xa0 for ahaz stripped the house of the lord and the house of the king and the princes and gave thereof unto the king of assyria but it helped him not\\xa0 and in the time of his distress did he act even more treacherously against the lord this same king ahaz\\xa0 for he sacrificed unto the gods of damascus which smote him and he said because the gods of the kings of aram helped them therefore will i sacrifice to them that they may help me but they were the ruin of him and of all israel\\xa0 and ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of god and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of god and shut up the doors of the house of the lord and he made him altars in every corner of jerusalem\\xa0 and in every city of judah he made high places to offer unto other gods and provoked the lord the god of his fathers\\xa0 now the rest of his acts and all his ways first and last behold they are written in the book of the kings of judah and israel\\xa0 and ahaz slept with his fathers and they buried him in the city even in jerusalem for they brought him not into the sepulchres of the kings of israel and hezekiah his son reigned in his stead \\xa0 hezekiah began to reign when he was five and twenty years old and he reigned nine and twenty years in jerusalem and his mothers name was abijah the daughter of zechariah\\xa0 and he did that which was right in the eyes of the lord according to all that david his father had done\\xa0 he in the first year of his reign in the first month opened the doors of the house of the lord and repaired them\\xa0 and he brought in the priests and the levites and gathered them together into the broad place on the east\\xa0 and said unto them hear me ye levites now sanctify yourselves and sanctify the house of the lord the god of your fathers and carry forth the filthiness out of the holy place\\xa0 for our fathers have acted treacherously and done that which was evil in the sight of the lord our god and have forsaken him and have turned away their faces from the habitation of the lord and turned their backs\\xa0 also they have shut up the doors of the porch and put out the lamps and have not burned incense nor offered burntofferings in the holy place unto the god of israel\\xa0 wherefore the wrath of the lord was upon judah and jerusalem and he hath delivered them to be a horror an astonishment and a hissing as ye see with your eyes\\xa0 for lo our fathers have fallen by the sword and our sons and our daughters and our wives are in captivity for this\\xa0 now it is in my heart to make a covenant with the lord the god of israel that his fierce anger may turn away from us\\xa0 my sons be not now negligent for the lord hath chosen you to stand before him to minister unto him and that ye should be his ministers and offer unto him \\xa0 then the levites arose mahath the son of amasai and joel the son of azariah of the sons of the kohathites and of the sons of merari kish the son of abdi and azariah the son of jehallelel s and of the gershonites joah the son of zimmah and eden the son of joah\\xa0 and of the sons of elizaphan shimri and jeiel and of the sons of asaph zechariah and mattaniah s\\xa0 and of the sons of heman jehiel and shimei s and of the sons of jeduthun shemaiah and uzziel\\xa0 and they gathered their brethren and sanctified themselves and went in according to the commandment of the king by the words of the lord to cleanse the house of the lord\\xa0 and the priests went in unto the inner part of the house of the lord to cleanse it and brought out all the uncleanness that they found in the temple of the lord into the court of the house of the lord and the levites took it to carry it out abroad to the brook kidron\\xa0 now they began on the first day of the first month to sanctify and on the eighth day of the month came they to the porch of the lord and they sanctified the house of the lord in eight days and on the sixteenth day of the first month they made an end s\\xa0 then they went in to hezekiah the king within  and said we have cleansed all the house of the lord even the altar of burntoffering with all the vessels thereof and the table of showbread with all the vessels thereof\\xa0 moreover all the vessels which king ahaz in his reign did cast away when he acted treacherously have we prepared and sanctified and behold they are before the altar of the lord s\\xa0 then hezekiah the king arose early and gathered the princes of the city and went up to the house of the lord\\xa0 and they brought seven bullocks and seven ',\n",
       "  'rams and seven lambs and seven hegoats for a sinoffering for the kingdom and for the sanctuary and for judah and he commanded the priests the sons of aaron to offer them on the altar of the lord\\xa0 so they killed the bullocks and the priests received the blood and dashed it against the altar and they killed the rams and dashed the blood against the altar they killed also the lambs and dashed the blood against the altar\\xa0 and they brought near the hegoats for the sinoffering before the king and the congregation and they laid their hands upon them\\xa0 and the priests killed them and they made a sinoffering with their blood upon the altar to make atonement for all israel for the king commanded that the burntoffering and the sinoffering should be made for all israel\\xa0 and he set the levites in the house of the lord with cymbals with psalteries and with harps according to the commandment of david and of gad the kings seer and nathan the prophet for the commandment was of the lord by his prophets\\xa0 and the levites stood with the instruments of david and the priests with the trumpets \\xa0 and hezekiah commanded to offer the burntoffering upon the altar and when the burntoffering began the song of the lord began also and the trumpets together with the instruments of david king of israel\\xa0 and all the congregation prostrated themselves and the singers sang and the trumpeters sounded all this continued until the burntoffering was finished\\xa0 and when they had made an end of offering the king and all that were present with him bowed themselves and prostrated themselves\\xa0 moreover hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the levites to sing praises unto the lord with the words of david and of asaph the seer and they sang praises with gladness and they bowed their heads and prostrated themselves \\xa0 then hezekiah answered and said now ye have consecrated yourselves unto the lord come near and bring sacrifices and thankofferings into the house of the lord and the congregation brought in sacrifices and thankofferings and as many as were of a willing heart brought burntofferings\\xa0 and the number of the burntofferings which the congregation brought was threescore and ten bullocks a hundred rams and two hundred lambs all these were for a burntoffering to the lord\\xa0 and the consecrated things were six hundred oxen and three thousand sheep\\xa0 but the priests were too few so that they could not flay all the burntofferings wherefore their brethren the levites did help them till the work was ended and until the priests had sanctified themselves for the levites were more upright in heart to sanctify themselves than the priests\\xa0 and also the burntofferings were in abundance with the fat of the peaceofferings and the drinkofferings for every burntoffering so the service of the house of the lord was firmly established\\xa0 and hezekiah rejoiced and all the people because of that which god had prepared for the people for the thing was done suddenly \\xa0 and hezekiah sent to all israel and judah and wrote letters also to ephraim and manasseh that they should come to the house of the lord at jerusalem to keep the passover unto the lord the god of israel\\xa0 for the king had taken counsel and his princes and all the congregation in jerusalem to keep the passover in the second month\\xa0 for they could not keep it at that time because the priests had not sanctified themselves in sufficient number neither had the people gathered themselves together to jerusalem\\xa0 and the thing was right in the eyes of the king and of all the congregation\\xa0 so they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all israel from beersheba even to dan that they should come to keep the passover unto the lord the god of israel at jerusalem for they had not kept it in great numbers according as it is written\\xa0 so the posts went with the letters from the king and his princes throughout all israel and judah and according to the commandment of the king saying ye children of israel turn back unto the lord the god of abraham isaac and israel that he may return to the remnant that are escaped of you out of the hand of the kings of assyria\\xa0 and be not ye like your fathers and like your brethren who acted treacherously against the lord the god of their fathers so that he delivered them to be an astonishment as ye see\\xa0 now be ye not stiffnecked as your fathers were but yield yourselves unto the lord and enter into his sanctuary which he hath sanctified for ever and serve the lord your god that his fierce anger may turn away from you\\xa0 for if ye turn back unto the lord your brethren and your children shall find compassion before them that led them captive and shall come back into this land for the lord your god is gracious and merciful and will not turn away his face from you if ye return unto him s\\xa0 so the posts passed from city to city through the country of ephraim and manasseh even unto zebulun but they laughed them to scorn and mocked them\\xa0 nevertheless divers of asher and manasseh and of zebulun humbled themselves and came to jerusalem\\xa0 also in judah was the hand of god to give them one heart to do the commandment of the king and of the princes by the word of the lord\\xa0 and there assembled at jerusalem much people to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month a very great congregation\\xa0 and they arose and took away the altars that were in jerusalem and all the altars for incense took they away and cast them into the brook kidron\\xa0 then they killed the passover lamb on the fourteenth day of the second month and the priests and the levites were ashamed and sanctified themselves and brought burntofferings into the house of the lord\\xa0 and they stood in their place after their order according to the law of moses the man of god the priests dashed the blood which they received of the hand of the levites\\xa0 for there were many in the congregation that had not sanctified themselves therefore the levites had the charge of killing the passover lambs for every one that was not clean to sanctify them unto the lord\\xa0 for a multitude of the people even many of ephraim and manasseh issachar and zebulun had not cleansed themselves yet did they eat the passover otherwise than it is written for hezekiah had prayed for them saying the good lord pardon\\xa0 every one that setteth his heart to seek god the lord the god of his fathers though  not  according to the purification that pertaineth to holy things s\\xa0 and the lord hearkened to hezekiah and healed the people s\\xa0 and the children of israel that were present at jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness and the levites and the priests praised the lord day by day singing with loud instruments unto the lord s\\xa0 and hezekiah spoke encouragingly unto all the levites that were well skilled in the service of the lord so they did eat throughout the feast for the seven days offering sacrifices of peaceofferings and giving thanks to the lord the god of their fathers s\\xa0 and the whole congregation took counsel to keep other seven days and they kept other seven days with gladness\\xa0 for hezekiah king of judah did give to the congregation for offerings a thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep s and the princes gave to the congregation a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep and priests sanctified themselves in great numbers\\xa0 and all the congregation of judah with the priests and the levites and all the congregation that came out of israel and the strangers that came out of the land of israel and that dwelt in judah rejoiced\\xa0 so there was great joy in jerusalem for since the time of solomon the son of david king of israel there was not the like in jerusalem s\\xa0 then the priests the levites arose and blessed the people and their voice was heard  and their prayer came up to his holy habitation even unto heaven \\xa0 now when all this was finished all israel that were present went out to the cities of judah and broke in pieces the pillars and hewed down the asherim and broke down the high places and the altars out of all judah and benjamin in ephraim also and manasseh until they had destroyed them all then all the children of israel returned every man to his possession into their own cities \\xa0 and hezekiah appointed the courses of the priest and the levites after their courses every man according to his service both the priests and the levites for burntofferings and for peaceofferings to minister and to give thanks and to praise in the gates of the camp of the lord s\\xa0 he appointed also the kings portion of his substance for the burntofferings to wit for the morning and evening burntofferings and the burntofferings for the sabbaths and for the new moons and for the appointed seasons as it is written in the law of the lord\\xa0 moreover he commanded the people that dwelt in jerusalem to give the portion of the priests and the levites that they might give themselves to the law of the lord\\xa0 and as soon as the commandment came abroad the children of israel gave in abundance the firstfruits of corn wine and oil and honey and of all the increase of the field and the tithe of all things brought they in abundantly\\xa0 and the children of israel and judah that dwelt in the cities of judah they also brought in the tithe of oxen and sheep and the tithe of hallowed things which were hallowed unto the lord their god and laid them by heaps s\\xa0 in the third month they began to lay the foundation of the heaps and finished them in the seventh month s\\xa0 and when hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps they blessed the lord and his people israel \\xa0 then hezekiah questioned the priests and the levites concerning the heaps\\xa0 and azariah the chief priest of the house of zadok answered him and said since the people began to bring the offerings into the house of the lord we have eaten and had enough and have left plenty for the lord hath blessed his people and that which is left is this great store s\\xa0 then hezekiah commanded to prepare chambers in the house of the lord and they prepared them\\xa0 and they brought in the offerings and the tithes and the hallowed things faithfully and over them conaniah the levite was ruler and shimei his brother was second\\xa0 and jehiel and azaziah and nahath and asahel and jerimoth and jozabad and eliel and ismachiah and mahath and benaiah were overseers under the hand of conaniah and shimei his brother by the appointment of hezekiah the king and azariah the ruler of the house of god\\xa0 and kore the son of imnah the levite the porter at the east gate was over the freewillofferings of god to distribute the offerings of the lord and the most holy things\\xa0 and under him were eden and miniamin and jeshua and shemaiah amariah and shecaniah in the cities of the priests in their office of trust to give to their brethren by courses as well to the great as to the small\\xa0 beside them that were reckoned by genealogy of males from three years old and upward even every one that entered into the house of the lord for his daily portion for their service in their charges according to their courses\\xa0 and them that were reckoned by genealogy of the priests by their fathers houses and the levites from twenty years old and upward in their charges by their courses\\xa0 even to give to them that were reckoned by genealogy of all their little ones their wives and their sons and their daughters through all the congregation for in their office of trust they administered the sacred gifts\\xa0 also for the sons of aaron the priests that were in the fields of the open land about their cities in every city there were men that were mentioned by name to give portions to all the males among the priests and to all that were reckoned by genealogy among the levites\\xa0 and thus did hezekiah throughout all judah and he wrought that which was good and right and faithful before the lord his god\\xa0 and in every work that he began in the service of the house of god and in the law and in the commandments to seek his god he did it with all his heart and prospered \\xa0 after these things and this faithfulness sennacherib king of assyria came and entered into judah and encamped against the fortified cities and thought to make a breach therein for himself\\xa0 and when hezekiah saw that sennacherib was come and that he was purposed to fight',\n",
       "  ' against jerusalem\\xa0 he took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the fountains which were without the city and they helped him\\xa0 so there was gathered much people together and they stopped all the fountains and the brook that flowed through the midst of the land saying why should the kings of assyria come and find much water\\xa0 and he took courage and built up all the wall that was broken down and raised it up to the towers and another wall without and strengthened millo in the city of david and made weapons and shields in abundance\\xa0 and he set captains of war over the people and gathered them together to him in the broad place at the gate of the city and spoke encouragingly to them saying\\xa0 be strong and of good courage be not afraid nor dismayed for the king of assyria nor for all the multitude that is with him for there is a greater with us than with him\\xa0 with him is an arm of flesh but with us is the lord our god to help us and to fight our battles and the people rested themselves upon the words of hezekiah king of judah \\xa0 after this did sennacherib king of assyria send his servants to jerusalemnow he was before lachish and all his power with himunto hezekiah king of judah and unto all judah that were at jerusalem saying\\xa0 thus saith sennacherib king of assyria whereon do ye trust that ye abide the siege in jerusalem\\xa0 doth not hezekiah persuade you to give you over to die by famine and by thirst saying the lord our god will deliver us out of the hand of the king of assyria\\xa0 hath not the same hezekiah taken away his high places and his altars and commanded judah and jerusalem saying ye shall worship before one altar and upon it shall ye offer\\xa0 know ye not what i and my fathers have done unto all the peoples of the lands were the gods of the nations of the lands in any wise able to deliver their land out of my hand\\xa0 who was there among all the gods of those nations which my fathers utterly destroyed that could deliver his people out of my hand that your god should be able to deliver you out of my hand\\xa0 now therefore let not hezekiah beguile you nor persuade you after this manner neither believe ye him for no god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people out of my hand and out of the hand of my fathers how much less shall your god deliver you out of my hand\\xa0 and his servants spoke yet more against the lord god and against his servant hezekiah\\xa0 he wrote also a letter to taunt the lord the god of israel and to speak against him saying as the gods of the nations of the lands which have not delivered their people out of my hand so shall not the god of hezekiah deliver his people out of my hand\\xa0 and they cried with a loud voice in the jews language unto the people of jerusalem that were on the wall to terrify them and to affright them that they might take the city\\xa0 and they spoke of the god of jerusalem as of the gods of the peoples of the earth which are the work of mens hands s\\xa0 and hezekiah the king and isaiah the prophet the son of amoz prayed because of this and cried to heaven s\\xa0 and the lord sent an angel who cut off all the mighty men of valour and the leaders and captains in the camp of the king of assyria so he returned with shame of face to his own land and when he was come into the house of his god they that came forth of his own bowels slew him there with the sword\\xa0 thus the lord saved hezekiah and the inhabitants of jerusalem from the hand of sennacherib the king of assyria and from the hand of all and guided them on every side\\xa0 and many brought gifts unto the lord to jerusalem and precious things to hezekiah king of judah so that he was exalted in the sight of all nations from thenceforth \\xa0 in those days hezekiah was sick even unto death and he prayed unto the lord and he spoke unto him and gave him a sign\\xa0 but hezekiah rendered not according to the benefit done unto him for his heart was lifted up therefore there was wrath upon him and upon judah and jerusalem\\xa0 notwithstanding hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart both he and the inhabitants of jerusalem so that the wrath of the lord came not upon them in the days of hezekiah\\xa0 and hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honour and he provided him treasuries for silver and for gold and for precious stones and for spices and for shields and for all manner of goodly vessels\\xa0 storehouses also for the increase of corn and wine and oil and stalls for all manner of beasts and flocks in folds\\xa0 moreover he provided him cities and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance for god had given him very much substance\\xa0 this same hezekiah also stopped the upper spring of the waters of gihon and brought them straight down on the west side of the city of david and hezekiah prospered in all his works\\xa0 howbeit in the business of the ambassadors of the princes of babylon who sent unto him to inquire of the wonder that was done in the land god left him to try him that he might know all that was in his heart\\xa0 now the rest of the acts of hezekiah and his good deeds behold they are written in the vision of isaiah the prophet the son of amoz and in the book of the kings of judah and israel\\xa0 and hezekiah slept with his fathers and they buried him in the ascent of the sepulchres of the sons of david and all judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem did him honour at his death and manasseh his son reigned in his stead \\xa0 manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign and he reigned fifty and five years in jerusalem\\xa0 and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord after the abominations of the nations whom the lord cast out before the children of israel\\xa0 for he built again the high places which hezekiah his father had broken down and he reared up altars for the baalim and made asheroth and worshipped all the host of heaven and served them\\xa0 and he built altars in the house of the lord whereof the lord said in jerusalem shall my name be for ever\\xa0 and he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the lord\\xa0 he also made his children to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of hinnom and he practised soothsaying and used enchantments and practised sorcery and appointed them that divined by a ghost or a familiar spirit he wrought much evil in the sight of the lord to provoke him\\xa0 and he set the graven image of the idol which he had made in the house of god of which god said to david and to solomon his son in this house and in jerusalem which i have chosen out of all the tribes of israel will i put my name for ever\\xa0 neither will i any more remove the foot of israel from off the land which i have appointed for your fathers if only they will observe to do all that i have commanded them even all the law and the statutes and the ordinances by the hand of moses\\xa0 and manasseh made judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem to err so that they did evil more than did the nations whom the lord destroyed before the children of israel \\xa0 and the lord spoke to manasseh and to his people but they gave no heed\\xa0 wherefore the lord brought upon them the captains of the host of the king of assyria who took manasseh with hooks and bound him with fetters and carried him to babylon\\xa0 and when he was in distress he besought the lord his god and humbled himself greatly before the god of his fathers\\xa0 and he prayed unto him and he was entreated of him and heard his supplication and brought him back to jerusalem into his kingdom then manasseh knew that the lord he was god\\xa0 now after this he built an outer wall to the city of david on the west side of gihon in the valley even to the entrance at the fish gate and he compassed about ophel and raised it up a very great height and he put captains of the army in all the fortified cities of judah\\xa0 and he took away the strange gods and the idol out of the house of the lord and all the altars that he had built in the mount of the house of the lord and in jerusalem and cast them out of the city\\xa0 and he built up the altar of the lord and offered thereon sacrifices of peaceofferings and of thanksgiving and commanded judah to serve the lord the god of israel\\xa0 nevertheless the people did sacrifice still in the high places but only unto the lord their god\\xa0 now the rest of the acts of manasseh and his prayer unto his god and the words of the seers that spoke to him in the name of the lord the god of israel behold they are written among the acts of the kings of israel\\xa0 his prayer also and how  was entreated of him and all his sin and his transgression and the places wherein he built high places and set up the asherim and the graven images before he humbled himself behold they are written in the history of the seers\\xa0 so manasseh slept with his fathers and they buried him in his own house and amon his son reigned in his stead \\xa0 amon was twenty and two years old when he began to reign and he reigned two years in jerusalem\\xa0 and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord as did manasseh his father and amon sacrificed unto all the graven images which manasseh his father had made and served them\\xa0 and he humbled not himself before the lord as manasseh his father had humbled himself but this same amon became guilty more and more\\xa0 and his servants conspired against him and put him to death in his own house\\xa0 but the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king amon and the people of the land made josiah his son king in his stead \\xa0 josiah was eight years old when he began to reign and he reigned thirty and one years in jerusalem\\xa0 and he did that which was right in the eyes of the lord and walked in the ways of david his father and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left\\xa0 for in the eighth year of his reign while he was yet young he began to seek after the god of david his father and in the twelfth year he began to purge judah and jerusalem from the high places and the asherim and the graven images and the molten images\\xa0 and they broke down the altars of the baalim in his presence and the sunimages that were on high above them he hewed down and the asherim and the graven images and the molten images he broke in pieces and made dust of them and strewed it upon the graves of them that had sacrificed unto them\\xa0 and he burnt the bones of the priests upon their altars and purged judah and jerusalem\\xa0 and so did he in the cities of manasseh and ephraim and simeon even unto naphtali with their axes round about\\xa0 and he broke down the altars and beat the asherim and the graven images into powder and hewed down all the sunimages throughout all the land of israel and returned to jerusalem \\xa0 now in the eighteenth year of his reign when he had purged the land and the house he sent shaphan the son of azaliah and maaseiah the governor of the city and joah the son of joahaz the recorder to repair the house of the lord his god\\xa0 and they came to hilkiah the high priest and delivered the money that was brought into the house of god which the levites the keepers of the door had gathered of the hand of manasseh and ephraim and of all the remnant of israel and of all judah and benjamin and they returned to jerusalem\\xa0 and they delivered it into the hand of the workmen that had the oversight of the house of the lord and the workmen that wrought in the house of the lord gave it to mend and repair the house\\xa0 even to the carpenters and to the builders gave they it to buy hewn stone and timber for couplings and to make beams for the houses which the kings of judah had destroyed s\\xa0 and the men did the work faithfully and the overseers of them were jahath and obadiah the levites of the sons of merari and zechariah and meshullam of the sons of the kohathites to preside over it and other of the levites all that had skill with instruments of music\\xa0 also they were over the bearers of burdens and presided over all that did the work in every manner of service and of the levites there were scribes and officers and porters\\xa0 and when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of the lord hilkiah the priest found the book of the law of the lord given by moses\\xa0 and hilkiah answered and said to shaphan the scribe i have found the book of the law in the house of the lord and hilkiah delivered the book',\n",
       "  ' to shaphan\\xa0 and shaphan carried the book to the king and moreover brought back word unto the king saying all that was committed to thy servants they do it\\xa0 and they have poured out the money that was found in the house of the lord and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers and into the hand of the workmen\\xa0 and shaphan the scribe told the king saying hilkiah the priest hath delivered me a book and shaphan read therein before the king\\xa0 and it came to pass when the king had heard the words of the law that he rent his clothes\\xa0 and the king commanded hilkiah and ahikam the son of shaphan and abdon the son of micah and shaphan the scribe and asaiah the kings servant saying\\xa0 go ye inquire of the lord for me and for them that are left in israel and in judah concerning the words of the book that is found for great is the wrath of the lord that is poured out upon us because our fathers have not kept the word of the lord to do according unto all that is written in this book\\xa0 so hilkiah and they whom the king  went to huldah the prophetess the wife of shallum the son of tokhath the son of hasrah keeper of the wardrobenow she dwelt in jerusalem in the second quarterand they spoke to her to that effect\\xa0 and she said unto them thus saith the lord the god of israel tell ye the man that sent you unto me s\\xa0 thus saith the lord behold i will bring evil upon this place and upon the inhabitants thereof even all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of judah\\xa0 because they have forsaken me and have offered unto other gods that they might provoke me with all the works of their hands therefore is my wrath poured out upon this place and it shall not be quenched\\xa0 but unto the king of judah who sent you to inquire of the lord thus shall ye say to him s thus saith the lord the god of israel as touching the words which thou hast heard\\xa0 because thy heart was tender and thou didst humble thyself before god when thou heardest his words against this place and against the inhabitants thereof and hast humbled thyself before me and hast rent thy clothes and wept before me i also have heard thee saith the lord\\xa0 behold i will gather thee to thy fathers and thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace neither shall thine eyes see all the evil that i will bring upon this place and upon the inhabitants thereof and they brought back word unto the king s\\xa0 then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of judah and jerusalem\\xa0 and the king went up to the house of the lord and all the men of judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem and the priests and the levites and all the people both great and small and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant that was found in the house of the lord\\xa0 and the king stood in his place and made a covenant before the lord to walk after the lord and to keep his commandments and his testimonies and his statutes with all his heart and with all his soul to perform the words of the covenant that were written in this book\\xa0 and he caused all that were found in jerusalem and benjamin to stand to it and the inhabitants of jerusalem did according to the covenant of god the god of their fathers\\xa0 and josiah took away all the abominations out of all the countries that pertained to the children of israel and made all that were found in israel to serve even to serve the lord their god all his days they departed not from following the lord the god of their fathers s\\xa0 and josiah kept a passover unto the lord in jerusalem and they killed the passover lamb on the fourteenth day of the first month\\xa0 and he set the priests in their charges and encouraged them to the service of the house of the lord s\\xa0 and he said unto the levites that taught all israel that were holy unto the lord put the holy ark in the house which solomon the son of david king of israel did build there shall no more be a burden upon your shoulders now serve the lord your god and his people israel\\xa0 and prepare ye after your fathers houses by your courses according to the writing of david king of israel and according to the writing of solomon his son\\xa0 and stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the fathers houses of your brethren the children of the people and  a portion of a fathers house of the levites\\xa0 and kill the passover lamb and sanctify yourselves and prepare for your brethren to do according to the word of the lord by the hand of moses \\xa0 and josiah gave to the children of the people of the flock lambs and kids all of them for the passoverofferings unto all that were present to the number of thirty thousand and three thousand bullocks these were of the kings substance s\\xa0 and his princes gave willingly unto the people to the priests and to the levites hilkiah and zechariah and jehiel the rulers of the house of god gave unto the priests for the passoverofferings two thousand and six hundred  and three hundred oxen\\xa0 conaniah also and shemaiah and nethanel his brethren and hashabiah and jeiel and jozabad the chiefs of the levites gave unto the levites for the passoverofferings five thousand  and five hundred oxen\\xa0 so the service was prepared and the priests stood in their place and the levites by their courses according to the kings commandment\\xa0 and they killed the passover lamb and the priests dashed  of their hand and the levites flayed them\\xa0 and they removed the portions that were to be burnt that they might give them to the divisions of the fathers houses of the children of the people to present unto the lord as it is written in the book of moses and so did they with the oxen\\xa0 and they roasted the passover with fire according to the ordinance and the holy offerings sod they in pots and in caldrons and in pans and carried them quickly to all the children of the people\\xa0 and afterward they prepared for themselves and for the priests because the priests the sons of aaron were busied in offering the portions that were to be burnt and the fat until night therefore the levites prepared for themselves and for the priests the sons of aaron\\xa0 and the singers the sons of asaph were in their place according to the commandment of david and asaph and heman and jeduthun the kings seer and the porters were at every gate they needed not to depart from their service for their brethren the levites prepared for them\\xa0 so all the service of the lord was prepared the same day to keep the passover and to offer burntofferings upon the altar of the lord according to the commandment of king josiah\\xa0 and the children of israel that were present kept the passover at that time and the feast of unleavened bread seven days\\xa0 and there was no passover like to that kept in israel from the days of samuel the prophet neither did any of the kings of israel keep such a passover as josiah kept and the priests and the levites and all judah and israel that were present and the inhabitants of jerusalem s\\xa0 in the eighteenth year of the reign of josiah was this passover kept\\xa0 after all this when josiah had prepared the temple neco king of egypt went up to fight against carchemish by the euphrates and josiah went out against him\\xa0 but he sent ambassadors to him saying what have i to do with thee thou king of judah i come not against thee this day but against the house wherewith i have war and god hath given command to speed me forbear thee from meddling with god who is with me that he destroy thee not\\xa0 nevertheless josiah would not turn his face from him but disguised himself that he might fight with him and hearkened not unto the words of neco from the mouth of god and came to fight in the valley of megiddo\\xa0 and the archers shot at king josiah and the king said to his servants have me away for i am sore wounded\\xa0 so his servants took him out of the chariot and put him in the second chariot that he had and brought him to jerusalem and he died and was buried in the sepulchres of his fathers and all judah and jerusalem mourned for josiah \\xa0 and jeremiah lamented for josiah and all the singing men and singing women spoke of josiah in their lamentations unto this day and they made them an ordinance in israel and behold they are written in the lamentations\\xa0 now the rest of the acts of josiah and his good deeds according to that which is written in the law of the lord\\xa0 and his acts first and last behold they are written in the book of the kings of israel and judah\\xa0 then the people of the land took jehoahaz the son of josiah and made him king in his fathers stead in jerusalem\\xa0 joahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign and he reigned three months in jerusalem\\xa0 and the king of egypt deposed him at jerusalem and fined the land a hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold\\xa0 and the king of egypt made eliakim his brother king over judah and jerusalem and changed his name to jehoiakim and neco took joahaz his brother and carried him to egypt \\xa0 jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign and he reigned eleven years in jerusalem and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord his god\\xa0 against him came up nebuchadnezzar king of babylon and bound him in fetters to carry him to babylon\\xa0 nebuchadnezzar also carried of the vessels of the house of the lord to babylon and put them in his temple at babylon\\xa0 now the rest of the acts of jehoiakim and his abominations which he did and that which was found in him behold they are written in the book of the kings of israel and judah and jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead \\xa0 jehoiachin was eight years old when he began to reign and he reigned three months and ten days in jerusalem and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord\\xa0 and at the return of the year king nebuchadnezzar sent and brought him to babylon with the goodly vessels of the house of the lord and made zedekiah his brother king over judah and jerusalem \\xa0 zedekiah was twenty and one years old when he began to reign and he reigned eleven years in jerusalem\\xa0 and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord his god he humbled not himself before jeremiah the prophet speaking from the mouth of the lord\\xa0 and he also rebelled against king nebuchadnezzar who had made him swear by god but he stiffened his neck and hardened his heart from turning unto the lord the god of israel\\xa0 moreover all the chiefs of the priests and the people transgressed very greatly after all the abominations of the nations and they polluted the house of the lord which he had hallowed in jerusalem\\xa0 and the lord the god of their fathers sent to them by his messengers sending betimes and often because he had compassion on his people and on his dwellingplace\\xa0 but they mocked the messengers of god and despised his words and scoffed at his prophets until the wrath of the lord arose against his people till there was no remedy\\xa0 therefore he brought upon them the king of the chaldeans who slew their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary and had no compassion upon young man or maiden old man or hoaryheaded he gave them all into his hand\\xa0 and all the vessels of the house of god great and small and the treasures of the house of the lord and the treasures of the king and of his princes all these he brought to babylon\\xa0 and they burnt the house of god and broke down the wall of jerusalem and burnt all the palaces thereof with fire and destroyed all the goodly vessels thereof\\xa0 and them that had escaped from the sword carried he away to babylon and they were servants to him and his sons until the reign of the kingdom of persia\\xa0 to fulfil the word of the lord by the mouth of jeremiah until the land had been paid her sabbaths for as long as she lay desolate she kept sabbath to fulfil threescore and ten years s\\xa0 now in the first year of cyrus king of persia that the word of the lord by the mouth of jeremiah might be accomplished the lord stirred up the spirit of cyrus king of persia that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom and put it also in writing saying s\\xa0 thus saith cyrus king of persia all the kingdoms of the earth hath the lord the god of heaven given me and he hath charged me to build him a house in jerusalem which is in judah whosoever there is

the ground there went in two and two unto noah into the ark male and female as god commanded noah and it came to pass after the seven days that the waters of the flood were upon the earth in the six hundredth year of noahs life in the second month on the seventeenth day of the month on the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up and the windows of heaven were opened and the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights in the selfsame day entered noah and shem and ham and japheth the sons of noah and noahs wife and the three wives of his sons with them into the ark they and every beast after its kind and all the cattle after their kind and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after its kind and every fowl after its kind every bird of every sort and they went in unto noah into the ark two and two of all flesh wherein is the breath of life and they that went in went in male and female of all flesh as god commanded him and the lord shut him in and the flood was forty days upon the earth and the waters increased and bore up the ark and it was lifted up above the earth and the waters prevailed and increased greatly upon the earth and the ark went upon the face of the waters and the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth and all the high mountains that were under the whole heaven were covered fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail and the mountains were covered and all flesh perished that moved upon the earth both fowl and cattle and beast and every swarming thing that swarmeth upon the earth and every man all in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life whatsoever was in the dry land died and he blotted out every living substance which was upon the face of the ground both man and cattle and creeping thing and fowl of the heaven and they were blotted out from the earth and noah only was left and they that were with him in the ark and the waters prevailed upon the earth a hundred and fifty days and god remembered noah and every living thing and all the cattle that were with him in the ark and god made a wind to pass over the earth and the waters assuaged the fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped and the rain from heaven was restrained and the waters returned from off the earth continually and after the end of a hundred and fifty days the waters decreased and the ark rested in the seventh month on the seventeenth day of the month upon the mountains of ararat and the waters decreased continually until the tenth month in the tenth month on the first day of the month were the tops of the mountains seen and it came to pass at the end of forty days that noah opened the window of the ark which he had made and he sent forth a raven and it went forth to and fro until the waters were dried up from off the earth and he sent forth a dove from him to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground but the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot and she returned unto him to the ark for the waters were on the face of the whole earth and he put forth his hand and took her and brought her in unto him into the ark and he stayed yet other seven days and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark and the dove came in to him at eventide and lo in her mouth an oliveleaf freshly plucked so noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth and he stayed yet other seven days and sent forth the dove and she returned not again unto him any more and it came to pass in the six hundred and first year in the first month the first day of the month the waters were dried up from off the earth and noah removed the covering of the ark and looked and behold the face of the ground was dried and in the second month on the seven and twentieth day of the month was the earth dry s and god spoke unto noah saying go forth from the ark thou and thy wife and thy sons and thy sons wives with thee bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee of all flesh both fowl and cattle and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth that they may swarm in the earth and be fruitful and multiply upon the earth and noah went forth and his sons and his wife and his sons wives with him every beast every creeping thing and every fowl whatsoever moveth upon the earth after their families went forth out of the ark and noah builded an altar unto the lord and took of every clean beast and of every clean fowl and offered burntofferings on the altar and the lord smelled the sweet savour and the lord said in his heart i will not again curse the ground any more for mans sake for the imagination of mans heart is evil from his youth neither will i again smite any more every thing living as i have done while the earth remaineth seedtime and harvest and cold and heat and summer and winter and day and night shall not cease and god blessed noah and his sons and said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth and upon every fowl of the air and upon all wherewith the ground teemeth and upon all the fishes of the sea into your hand are they delivered every moving thing that liveth shall be for food for you as the green herb have i given you all only flesh with the life thereof which is the blood thereof shall ye not eat and surely your blood of your lives will i require at the hand of every beast will i require it and at the hand of man even at the hand of every mans brother will i require the life of man whoso sheddeth mans blood by man shall his blood be shed for in the image of god made he man and you be ye fruitful and multiply swarm in the earth and multiply therein s and god spoke unto noah and to his sons with him saying as for me behold i establish my covenant with you and with your seed after you and with every living creature that is with you the fowl the cattle and every beast of the earth with you of all that go out of the ark even every beast of the earth and i will establish my covenant with you neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of the flood neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth and god said this is the token of the covenant which i make between me and you and every living creature that is with you for perpetual generations i have set my bow in the cloud and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth and it shall come to pass when i bring clouds over the earth and the bow is seen in the cloud that i will remember my covenant which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh and the bow shall be in the cloud and i will look upon it that i may remember the everlasting covenant between god and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth and god said unto noah this is the token of the covenant which i have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth  and the sons of noah that went forth from the ark were shem and ham and japheth and ham is the father of canaan these three were the sons of noah and of these was the whole earth overspread and noah the husbandman began and planted a vineyard and he drank of the wine and was drunken and he was uncovered within his tent and ham the father of canaan saw the nakedness of his father and told his two brethren without and shem and japheth took a garment and laid it upon both their shoulders and went backward and covered the nakedness of their father and their faces were backward and they saw not their fathers nakedness and noah awoke from his wine and knew what his youngest son had done unto him and he said cursed be canaan a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren and he said blessed be the lord the god of shem and let canaan be their servant god enlarge japheth and he shall dwell in the tents of shem and let canaan be their servant and noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years and all the days of noah were nine hundred and fifty years and he died  now these are the generations of the sons of noah shem ham and japheth and unto them were sons born after the flood the sons of japheth gomer and magog and madai and javan and tubal and meshech and tiras and the sons of gomer ashkenaz and riphath and togarmah and the sons of javan elishah and tarshish kittim and dodanim of these were the isles of the nations divided in their lands every one after his tongue after their families in their nations and the sons of ham cush and mizraim and put and canaan and the sons of cush seba and havilah and sabtah and raamah and sabteca and the sons of raamah sheba and dedan and cush begot nimrod he began to be a might',\n",
       "  'y one in the earth he was a mighty hunter before the lord wherefore it is said like nimrod a mighty hunter before the lord and the beginning of his kingdom was babel and erech and accad and calneh in the land of shinar out of that land went forth asshur and builded nineveh and rehobothir and calah and resen between nineveh and calahthe same is the great city and mizraim begot ludim and anamim and lehabim and naphtuhim and pathrusim and casluhimwhence went forth the philistinesand caphtorim s and canaan begot zidon his firstborn and heth and the jebusite and the amorite and the girgashite and the hivite and the arkite and the sinite and the arvadite and the zemarite and the hamathite and afterward were the families of the canaanite spread abroad and the border of the canaanite was from zidon as thou goest toward gerar unto gaza as thou goest toward sodom and gomorrah and admah and zeboiim unto lasha these are the sons of ham after their families after their tongues in their lands in their nations s and unto shem the father of all the children of eber the elder brother of japheth to him also were children born the sons of shem elam and asshur and arpachshad and lud and aram and the sons of aram uz and hul and gether and mash and arpachshad begot shelah and shelah begot eber and unto eber were born two sons the name of the one was peleg for in his days was the earth divided and his brothers name was joktan and joktan begot almodad and sheleph and hazarmaveth and jerah and hadoram and uzal and diklah and obal and abimael and sheba and ophir and havilah and jobab all these were the sons of joktan and their dwelling was from mesha as thou goest toward sephar unto the mountain of the east these are the sons of shem after their families after their tongues in their lands after their nations these are the families of the sons of noah after their generations in their nations and of these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood  and the whole earth was of one language and of one speech and it came to pass as they journeyed east that they found a plain in the land of shinar and they dwelt there and they said one to another come let us make brick and burn them thoroughly and they had brick for stone and slime had they for mortar and they said come let us build us a city and a tower with its top in heaven and let us make us a name lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth and the lord came down to see the city and the tower which the children of men builded and the lord said behold they are one people and they have all one language and this is what they begin to do and now nothing will be withholden from them which they purpose to do come let us go down and there confound their language that they may not understand one anothers speech so the lord scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth and they left off to build the city therefore was the name of it called babel because the lord did there confound the language of all the earth and from thence did the lord scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth  these are the generations of shem shem was a hundred years old and begot arpachshad two years after the flood and shem lived after he begot arpachshad five hundred years and begot sons and daughters s and arpachshad lived five and thirty years and begot shelah and arpachshad lived after he begot shelah four hundred and three years and begot sons and daughters s and shelah lived thirty years and begot eber and shelah lived after he begot

seventy years and begot abram nahor and haran now these are the generations of terah terah begot abram nahor and haran and haran begot lot and haran died in the presence of his father terah in the land of his nativity in ur of the chaldees and abram and nahor took them wives the name of abrams wife was sarai and the name of nahors wife milcah the daughter of haran the father of milcah and the father of iscah and sarai was barren she had no child and terah took abram his son and lot the son of haran his sons son and sarai his daughterinlaw his son abrams wife and they went forth with them from ur of the chaldees to go into the land of canaan and they came unto haran and dwelt there and the days of terah were two hundred and five years and terah died in haran  now the lord said unto abram get thee out of thy country and from thy kindred and from thy fathers house unto the land that i will show thee and i will make of thee a great nation and i will bless thee and make thy name great and be thou a blessing and i will bless them that bless thee and him that curseth thee will i curse and in thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed so abram went as the lord had spoken unto him and lot went with him and abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of haran and abram took sarai his wife and lot his brothers son and all their substance that they had gathered and the souls that they had gotten in haran and they went forth to go into the land of canaan and into the land of canaan they came and abram passed through the land unto the place of shechem unto the terebinth of moreh and the canaanite was then in the land and the lord appeared unto abram and said unto thy seed will i give this land and he builded there an altar unto the lord who appeared unto him and he removed from thence unto the mountain on the east of bethel and pitched his tent having bethel on the west and ai on the east and he builded there an altar unto the lord and called upon the name of the lord and abram journeyed going on still toward the south  and there was a famine in the land and abram went down into egypt to sojourn there for the famine was sore in the land and it came to pass when he was come near to enter into egypt that he said unto sarai his wife behold now i know that thou art a fair woman to look upon and it will come to pass when the egyptians shall see thee that they will say this is his wife and they will kill me but thee they will keep alive say i pray thee thou art my sister that it may be well with me for thy sake and that my soul may live because of thee and it came to pass that when abram was come into egypt the egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair and the princes of pharaoh saw her and praised her to pharaoh and the woman was taken into pharaohs house and he dealt well with abram for her sake and he had sheep and oxen and heasses and menservants and maidservants and sheasses and camels and the lord plagued pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of sarai abrams wife and pharaoh called abram and said what is this that thou hast done unto me why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife why saidst thou she is my sister so that i took her to be my wife now therefore behold thy wife take her and go thy way and pharaoh gave men charge concerning him and they brought him on the way and his wife and all that he had and abram went up out of egypt he and his wife and all that he had and lot with him into the south and abram was very rich in cattle in silver and in gold and he went on his journeys from the south even to bethel unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning between bethel and ai unto the place of the altar which he had made there at the first and abram called there on the name of the lord and lot also who went with abram had flocks and herds and tents and the land was not able to bear them that they might dwell together for their substance was great so that they could not dwell together and there was a strife between the herdmen of abrams cattle and the herdmen of lots cattle and the canaanite and the perizzite dwelt then in the land and abram said unto lot let there be no strife i pray thee between me and thee and between my herdmen and thy herdmen for we are brethren is not the whole land before thee separate thyself i pray thee from me if thou wilt take the left hand then i will go to the right or if thou take the right hand then i will go to the left and lot lifted up his eyes and beheld all the plain of the jordan that it was well watered every where before the lord destroyed sodom and gomorrah like the garden of the lord like the land of egypt as thou goest unto zoar so lot chose him all the plain of the jordan and lot journeyed east and they separated themselves the one from the other abram dwelt in the land of canaan and lot dwelt in the cities of the plain and moved his tent as far as sodom now the men of sodom were wicked and sinners against the lord exceedingly and the lord said unto abram after that lot was separated from him lift up now thine eyes and look from the place where thou art northward and southward and eastward and westward for ',\n",
       "  'all the land which thou seest to thee will i give it and to thy seed for ever and i will make thy seed as the dust of the earth so that if a man can number the dust of the earth then shall thy seed also be numbered arise walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it for unto thee will i give it and abram moved his tent and came and dwelt by the terebinths of mamre which are in hebron and built there an altar unto the lord  and it came to pass in the days of amraphel king of shinar arioch king of ellasar chedorlaomer king of elam and tidal king of goiim that they made war with bera king of sodom and with birsha king of gomorrah shinab king of admah and shemeber king of zeboiim and the king of belathe same is zoar all these came as allies unto the vale of siddimthe same is the salt sea twelve years they served chedorlaomer and in the thirteenth year they rebelled and in the fourteenth year came chedorlaomer and the kings that were with him and smote the rephaim in ashterothkarnaim and the zuzim in ham and the emim in shavehkiriathaim and the horites in their mount seir unto elparan which is by the wilderness and they turned back and came to enmishpatthe same is kadeshand smote all the country of the amalekites and also the amorites that dwelt in hazazontamar and there went out the king of sodom and the king of gomorrah and the king of admah and the king of zeboiim and the king of belathe same is zoar and they set the battle in array against them in the vale of siddim against chedorlaomer king of elam and tidal king of goiim and amraphel king of shinar and arioch king of ellasar four kings against the five now the vale of siddim was full of slime pits and the kings of sodom and gomorrah fled and they fell there and they that remained fled to the mountain and they took all the goods of sodom and gomorrah and all their victuals and went their way and they took lot abrams brothers son who dwelt in sodom and his goods and departed and there came one that had escaped and told abram the hebrewnow he dwelt by the terebinths of mamre the amorite brother of eshcol and brother of aner and these were confederate with abram and when abram heard that his brother was taken captive he led forth his trained men born in his house three hundred and eighteen and pursued as far as dan and he divided himself against them by night he and his servants and smote them and pursued them unto hobah which is on the left hand of damascus and he brought back all the goods and also brought back his brother lot and his goods and the women also and the people and the king of sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of chedorlaomer and the kings that were with him at the vale of shavehthe same is the kings vale and melchizedek king of salem brought forth bread and wine and he was priest of god the most high and he blessed him and said blessed be abram of god most high maker of heaven and earth and blessed be god the most high who hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand and he gave him a tenth of all and the king of sodom said unto abram give me the persons and take the goods to thyself and abram said to the king of sodom i have lifted up my hand unto the lord god most high maker of heaven and earth that i will not take a thread nor a shoelatchet nor aught that is thine lest thou shouldest say i have made abram rich save only that which the young men have eaten and the portion of the men which went with me aner eshcol and mamre let them take their portion s after these things the word of the lord came unto abram in a vision saying fear not abram i am thy shield thy reward shall be exceeding great and abram said o lord god what wilt thou give me seeing i go hence childless and he that shall be possessor of my house is eliezer of damascus and abram said behold to me thou hast given no seed and lo one born in my house is to be mine heir and behold the word of the lord came unto him saying this man shall not be thine heir but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir and he brought him forth abroad and said look now toward heaven and count the stars if thou be able to count them and he said unto him so shall thy seed be and he believed in the lord and he counted it to him for righteousness and he said unto him i am the lord that brought thee out of ur of the chaldees to give thee this land to inherit it and he said o lord god whereby shall i know that i shall inherit it and he said unto him take me a heifer of three years old and a shegoat of three years old and a ram of three years old and a turtledove and a young pigeon and he took him all these and divided them in the midst and laid each half over against the other but the birds divided he not and the birds of prey came down upon the carcasses and abram drove them away and it came to pass that when the sun was going down a deep sleep fell upon abram and lo a dread even a great darkness fell upon him and he said unto abram know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs and shall serve them and they shall afflict them four hundred years and also that nation whom they shall serve will i judge and afterward shall they come out with great substance but thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace thou shalt be buried in a good old age and in the fourth generation they shall come back hither for the iniquity of the amorite is not yet full and it came to pass that when the sun went down and there was thick darkness behold a smoking furnace and a flaming torch that passed between these pieces in that day the lord made a covenant with abram saying unto thy seed have i given this land from the river of egypt unto the great river the river euphrates the kenite and the kenizzite and the kadmonite and the hittite and the perizzite and the rephaim and the amorite and the canaanite and the girgashite and the jebusite s now sarai abrams wife bore him no children and she had a handmaid an egyptian whose name was hagar and sarai said unto abram behold now the lord hath restrained me from bearing go in i pray thee unto my handmaid it may be that i shall be builded up through her and abram hearkened to the voice of sarai and sarai abrams wife took hagar the egyptian her handmaid after abram had dwelt ten years in the land of canaan and gave her to abram her husband to be his wife and he went in unto hagar and she conceived and when she saw that she had conceived her mistress was despised in her eyes and sarai said unto abram my wrong be upon thee i gave my handmaid into thy bosom and when she saw that she had conceived i was despised in her eyes the lord judge between me and thee but abram said unto sarai behold thy maid is in thy hand do to her that which is good in thine eyes and sarai dealt harshly with her and she fled from her face and the angel of the lord found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness by the fountain in the way to shur and he said hagar sarais handmaid whence camest thou and whither goest thou and she said i flee from the face of my mistress sarai and the angel of the lord said unto her return to thy mistress and submit thyself under her hands and the angel of the lord said unto her i will greatly multiply thy seed that it shall not be numbered for multitude and the angel of the lord said unto her behold thou art with child and shalt bear a son and thou shalt call his name ishmael because the lord hath heard thy affliction and he shall be a wild ass of a man his hand shall be against every man and every mans hand against him and he shall dwell in the face of all his brethren and she called the name of the lord that spoke unto her thou art a god of seeing for she said have i even here seen him that seeth me wherefore the well was called beerlahairoi behold it is between kadesh and bered and hagar bore abram a son and abram called the name of his son whom hagar bore ishmael and abram was fourscore and six years old when hagar bore ishmael to abram s and when abram was ninety years old and nine the lord appeared to abram and said unto him i am god almighty walk before me and be thou wholehearted and i will make my covenant between me and thee and will multiply thee exceedingly and abram fell on his face and god talked with him saying as for me behold my covenant is with thee and thou shalt be the father of a multitude of nations neither shall thy name any more be called abram but thy name shall be abraham for the father of a multitude of nations have i made thee and i will make thee exceeding fruitful and i will make nations of thee and kings shall come out of thee and i will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee throughout their generations for an everlasting covenant to be a god unto thee and to thy seed after thee and i will give unto thee and to thy seed after thee the land of thy sojournings all the land of canaan for an everlasting possession and i will be their god and god said unto abraham and as for thee thou shalt keep my covenant thou and thy seed after thee throughout their generations this is my covenant which ye shall keep between me and you and thy seed after thee every male among you shall be circumcised and ye shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskin and it shall be a token of a covenant betwixt me and you and he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you every male throughout your generations he that is born in the house or bought with money of any foreigner that is not o',\n",
       "  'f thy seed he that is born in thy house and he that is bought with thy money must needs be circumcised and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant and the uncircumcised male who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin that soul shall be cut off from his people he hath broken my covenant s and god said unto abraham as for sarai thy wife thou shalt not call her name sarai but sarah shall her name be and i will bless her and moreover i will give thee a son of her yea i will bless her and she shall be a mother of nations kings of peoples shall be of her then abraham fell upon his face and laughed and said in his heart shall a child be born unto him that is a hundred years old and shall sarah that is ninety years old bear and abraham said unto god oh that ishmael might live before thee and god said nay but sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son and thou shalt call his name isaac and i will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant for his seed after him and as for ishmael i have heard thee behold i have blessed him and will make him fruitful and will multiply him exceedingly twelve princes shall he beget and i will make him a great nation but my covenant will i establish with isaac whom sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year and he left off talking with him and god went up from abraham and abraham took ishmael his son and all that were born in his house and all that were bought with his money every male among the men of abrahams house and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day as god had said unto him and abraham was ninety years old and nine when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin and ishmael his son was thirteen years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin in the selfsame day was abraham circumcised and ishmael his son and all the men of his house those born in the house and those bought with money of a foreigner were circumcised with him  and the lord appeared unto him by the terebinths of mamre as he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day and he lifted up his eyes and looked and lo three men stood over against him and when he saw them he ran to meet them from the tent door and bowed down to the earth and said my lord if now i have found favour in thy sight pass not away i pray thee from thy servant let now a little water be fetched and wash your feet and recline yourselves under the tree and i will fetch a morsel of bread and stay ye your heart after that ye shall pass on forasmuch as ye are come to your servant and they said so do as thou hast said and abraham hastened into the tent unto sarah and said make ready quickly three measures of fine meal knead it and make cakes and abraham ran unto the herd and fetched a calf tender and good and gave it unto the servant and he hastened to dress it and he took curd and milk and the calf which he had dressed and set it before them and he stood by them under the tree and they did eat and they said unto him where is sarah thy wife and he said behold in the tent and he said i will certainly return unto thee when the season cometh round and lo sarah thy wife shall have a son and sarah heard in the tent door which was behind him now abraham and sarah were old and well stricken in age it had ceased to be with sarah after the manner of women and sarah laughed within herself saying after i am waxed old shall i have pleasure my lord being old also and the lord said unto abraham wherefore did sarah laugh saying shall i of a surety bear a child who am old is any thing too hard for the lord at the set time i will return unto thee when the season cometh round and sarah shall have a son then sarah denied saying i laughed not for she was afraid and he said nay but thou didst laugh and the men rose up from thence and looked out toward sodom and abraham went with them to bring them on the way and the lord said shall i hide from abraham that which i am doing seeing that abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him for i have known him to the end that he may command his children and his household after him that they may keep the way of the lord to do righteousness and justice to the end that the lord may bring upon abraham that which he hath spoken of him and the lord said verily the cry of sodom and gomorrah is great and verily their sin is exceeding grievous i will go down now and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it which is come unto me and if not i will know and the men turned from thence and went toward sodom but abraham stood yet before the lord and abraham drew near and said wilt thou indeed sweep away the righteous with the wicked peradventure there are fifty righteous within the city wilt thou indeed sweep away and not forgive the place for the fifty righteous that are therein that be far from thee to do after this manner to slay the righteous with the wicked that so the righteous should be as the wicked that be far from thee shall not the judge of all the earth do justly and the lord said if i find in sodom fifty righteous within the city then i will forgive all the place for their sake and abraham answered and said behold now i have taken upon me to speak unto the lord who am but dust and ashes peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five and he said i will not destroy it if i find there forty and five and he spoke unto him yet again and said peradventure there shall be forty found there and he said i will not do it for the fortys sake and he said oh let not the lord be angry and i will speak peradventure there shall thirty be found there and he said i will not do it if i find thirty there and he said behold now i have taken upon me to speak unto the lord peradventure there shall be twenty found there and he said i will not destroy it for the twentys sake and he said oh let not the lord be angry and i will speak yet but this once peradventure ten shall be found there and he said i will not destroy it for the tens sake and the lord went his way as soon as he had left off speaking to abraham and abraham returned unto his place and the two angels came to sodom at even and lot sat in the gate of sodom and lot saw them and rose up to meet them and he fell down on his face to the earth and he said behold now my lords turn aside i pray you into your servants house and tarry all night and wash your feet and ye shall rise up early and go on your way and they said nay but we will abide in the broad place all night and he urged them greatly and they turned in unto him and entered into his house and he made them a feast and did bake unleavened bread and they did eat but before they lay down the men of the city even the men of sodom compassed the house round both young and old all the people from every quarter and they called unto lot and said unto him where are the men that came in to thee this night bring them out unto us that we may know them and lot went out unto them to the door and shut the door after him and he said i pray you my brethren do not so wickedly behold now i have two daughters that have not known man let me i pray you bring them out unto you and do ye to them as is good in your eyes only unto these men do nothing forasmuch as they are come under the shadow of my roof and they said stand back and they said this one fellow came in to sojourn and he will needs play the judge now will we deal worse with thee than with them and they pressed sore upon the man even lot and drew near to break the door but the men put forth their hand and brought lot into the house to them and the door they shut and they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness both small and great so that they wearied themselves to find the door and the men said unto lot hast thou here any besides soninlaw and thy sons and thy daughters and whomsoever thou hast in the city bring them out of the place for we will destroy this place because the cry of them is waxed great before the lord and the lord hath sent us to destroy it and lot went out and spoke unto his sonsinlaw who married his daughters and said up get you out of this place for the lord will destroy the city but he seemed unto his sonsinlaw as one that jested and when the morning arose then the angels hastened lot saying arise take thy wife and thy two daughters that are here lest thou be swept away in the iniquity of the city but he lingered and the men laid hold upon his hand and upon the hand of his wife and upon the hand of his two daughters the lord being merciful unto him and they brought him forth and set him without the city and it came to pass when they had brought them forth abroad that he said escape for thy life look not behind thee neither stay thou in all the plain escape to the mountain lest thou be swept away and lot said unto them oh not so my lord behold now thy servant hath found grace in thy sight and thou hast magnified thy mercy which thou hast shown unto me in saving my life and i cannot escape to the mountain lest the evil overtake me and i die behold now this city is near to flee unto and it is a little one oh let me escape thitheris it not a little oneand my soul shall live and he said unto him see i have accepted thee concerning this thing also that i will not overthrow the city of which thou hast spoken hasten thou escape thither for i cannot do any thing till thou be',\n",
       "  ' come thithertherefore the name of the city was called zoar the sun was risen upon the earth when lot came unto zoar then the lord caused to rain upon sodom and upon gomorrah brimstone and fire from the lord out of heaven and he overthrow those cities and all the plain and all the inhabitants of the cities and that which grew upon the ground but his wife looked back from behind him and she became a pillar of salt and abraham got up early in the morning to the place where he had stood before the lord and he looked out toward sodom and gomorrah and toward all the land of the plain and beheld and lo the smoke of the land went up as the smoke of a furnace and it came to pass when god destroyed the cities of the plain that god remembered abraham and sent lot out of the midst of the overthrow when he overthrew the cities in which lot dwelt and lot went up out of zoar and dwelt in the mountain and his two daughters with him for he feared to dwell in zoar and he dwelt in a cave he and his two daughters and the firstborn said unto the younger our father is old and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth come let us make our father drink wine and we will lie with him that we may preserve seed of our father and they made their father drink wine that night and the firstborn went in and lay with her father and he knew not when she lay down nor when she arose and it came to pass on the morrow that the firstborn said unto the younger behold i lay yesternight with my father let us make him drink wine this night also and go thou in and lie with him that we may preserve seed of our father and they made their father drink wine that night also and the younger arose and lay with him and he knew not when she lay down nor when she arose thus were both the daughters of lot with child by their father and the firstborn bore a son and called his name moabthe same is the father of the moabites unto this day and the younger she also bore a son and called his name benammithe same is the father of the children of ammon unto this day s and abraham journeyed from thence toward the land of the south and dwelt between kadesh and shur and he sojourned in gerar and abraham said of sarah his wife she is my sister and abimelech king of gerar sent and took sarah but god came to abimelech in a dream of the night and said to him behold thou shalt die because of the woman whom thou hast taken for she is a mans wife now abimelech had not come near her and he said lord wilt thou slay even a righteous nation said he not himself unto me she is my sister and she even she herself said he is my brother in the simplicity of my heart and the innocency of my hands have i done this and god said unto him in the dream yea i know that in the simplicity of thy heart thou hast done this and i also withheld thee from sinning against me therefore suffered i thee not to touch her now therefore restore the mans wife for he is a prophet and he shall pray for thee and thou shalt live and if thou restore her not know thou that thou shalt surely die thou and all that are thine and abimelech rose early in the morning and called all his servants and told all these things in their ears and the men were sore afraid then abimelech called abraham and said unto him what hast thou done unto us and wherein have i sinned against thee that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done and abimelech said unto abraham what sawest thou that thou hast done this thing and abraham said because i thought surely the fear of god is not in this place and they will slay me for my wifes sake and moreover she is indeed my sister the daughter of my father but not the daughter of my mother and so she became my wife and it came to pass when god caused me to wander from my fathers house that i said unto her this is thy kindness which thou shalt show unto me at every place whither we shall come say of me he is my brother and abimelech took sheep and oxen and menservants and womenservants and gave them unto abraham and restored him sarah his wife and abimelech said behold my land is before thee dwell where it pleaseth thee and unto sarah he said behold i have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver behold it is for thee a covering of the eyes to all that are with thee and before all men thou art righted and abraham prayed unto god and god healed abimelech and his wife and his maidservants and they bore children for the lord had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of abimelech because of sarah abrahams wife s and the lord remembered sarah as he had said and the lord did unto sarah as he had spoken and sarah conceived and bore abraham a son in his old age at the set time of which god had spoken to him and abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him whom sarah bore to him isaac and abraham circumcised his son isaac when he was eight days old as god had commanded him and abraham was a hundred years old when his son isaac was born unto him and sarah said god hath made laughter for me every one that heareth will laugh on account of me and she said who would have said unto abraham that sarah should give children suck for i have borne him a son in his old age and the child grew and was weaned and abraham made a great feast on the day that isaac was weaned and sarah saw the son of hagar the egyptian whom she had borne unto abraham making sport wherefore she said unto abraham cast out this bondwoman and her son for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son even with isaac and the thing was very grievous in abrahams sight on account of his son and god said unto abraham let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad and because of thy bondwoman in all that sarah saith unto thee hearken unto her voice for in isaac shall seed be called to thee and also of the son of the bondwoman will i make a nation because he is thy seed and abraham arose up early in the morning and took bread and a bottle of water and gave it unto hagar putting it on her shoulder and the child and sent her away and she departed and strayed in the wilderness of beersheba and the water in the bottle was spent and she cast the child under one of the shrubs and she went and sat her down over against him a good way off as it were a bowshot for she said let me not look upon the death of the child and she sat over against him and lifted up her voice and wept and god heard the voice of the lad and the angel of god called to hagar out of heaven and said unto her what aileth thee hagar fear not for god hath heard the voice of the lad where he is arise lift up the lad and hold him fast by thy hand for i will make him a great nation and god opened her eyes and she saw a well of water and she went and filled the bottle with water and gave the lad drink and god was with the lad and he grew and he dwelt in the wilderness and became an archer and he dwelt in the wilderness of paran and his mother took him a wife out of the land of egypt  and it came to pass at that time that abimelech and phicol the captain of his host spoke unto abraham saying god is with thee in all that thou doest now therefore swear unto me here by god that thou wilt not deal falsely with me nor with my son nor with my sons son but according to the kindness that i have done unto thee thou shalt do unto me and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned and abraham said i will swear and abraham reproved abimelech because of the well of water which abimelechs servants had violently taken away and abimelech said i know not who hath done this thing neither didst thou tell me neither yet heard i of it but today and abraham took sheep and oxen and gave them unto abimelech and they two made a covenant and abraham set seven ewelambs of the flock by themselves and abimelech said unto abraham what mean these seven ewelambs which thou hast set by themselves and he said verily these seven ewelambs shalt thou take of my hand that it may be a witness unto me that i have digged this well wherefore that place was called beersheba because there they swore both of them so they made a covenant at beersheba and abimelech rose up and phicol the captain of his host and they returned into the land of the philistines and abraham planted a tamarisktree in beersheba and called there on the name of the lord the everlasting god and abraham sojourned in the land of the philistines many days  and it came to pass after these things that god did prove abraham and said unto him abraham and he said here am i and he said take now thy son thine only son whom thou lovest even isaac and get thee into the land of moriah and offer him there for a burntoffering upon one of the mountains which i will tell thee of and abraham rose early in the morning and saddled his ass and took two of his young men with him and isaac his son and he cleaved the wood for the burntoffering and rose up and went unto the place of which god had told him on the third day abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place afar off and abraham said unto his young men abide ye here with the ass and i and the lad will go yonder and we will worship and come back to you and abraham took the wood of the burntoffering and laid it upon isaac his son and he took in his hand the fire and the knife and they went both of them together and isaac spoke unto abraham his father and said my father and he said here am i my son and he said behold the fire and the wood but wh',\n",
       "  'ere is the lamb for a burntoffering and abraham said god will provide himself the lamb for a burntoffering my son so they went both of them together and they came to the place which god had told him of and abraham built the altar there and laid the wood in order and bound isaac his son and laid him on the altar upon the wood and abraham stretched forth his hand and took the knife to slay his son and the angel of the lord called unto him out of heaven and said abraham abraham and he said here am i and he said lay not thy hand upon the lad neither do thou any thing unto him for now i know that thou art a godfearing man seeing thou hast not withheld thy son thine only son from me and abraham lifted up his eyes and looked and behold behind him a ram caught in the thicket by his horns and abraham went and took the ram and offered him up for a burntoffering in the stead of his son and abraham called the name of that place adonaijireh as it is said to this day in the mount where the lord is seen and the angel of the lord called unto abraham a second time out of heaven and said by myself have i sworn saith the lord because thou hast done this thing and hast not withheld thy son thine only son that in blessing i will bless thee and in multiplying i will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven and as the sand which is upon the seashore and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed because thou hast hearkened to my voice so abraham returned unto his young men and they rose up and went together to beersheba and abraham dwelt at beersheba  and it came to pass after these things that it was told abraham saying behold milcah she also hath borne children unto thy brother nahor uz his firstborn and buz his brother and kemuel the father of aram and chesed and hazo and pildash and jidlaph and bethuel and bethuel begot rebekah these eight did milcah bear to nahor abrahams brother and his concubine whose name was reumah she also bore tebah and gaham and tahash and maacah  and the life of sarah was a hundred and seven and twenty years these were the years of the life of sarah and sarah died in kiriatharbathe same is hebronin the land of canaan and abraham came to mourn for sarah and to weep for her and abraham rose up from before his dead and spoke unto the children of heth saying i am a stranger and a sojourner with you give me a possession of a buryingplace with you that i may bury my dead out of my sight and the children of heth answered abraham saying unto him hear us my lord thou art a mighty prince among us in the choice of our sepulchres bury thy dead none of us shall withhold from thee his sepulchre but that thou mayest bury thy dead and abraham rose up and bowed down to the people of the land even to the children of heth and he spoke with them saying if it be your mind that i should bury my dead out of my sight hear me and entreat for me to ephron the son of zohar that he may give me the cave of machpelah which he hath which is in the end of his field for the full price let him give it to me in the midst of you for a possession of a buryingplace now ephron was sitting in the midst of the children of heth and ephron the hittite answered abraham in the hearing of the children of heth even of all that went in at the gate of his city saying nay my lord hear me the field give i thee and the cave that is therein i give it thee in the presence of the sons of my people give i it thee bury thy dead and abraham bowed down before the people of the land and he spoke unto ephron in the hearing of the people of the land saying but if thou wilt i pray thee hear me i will give the price of the field take it of me and i will bury my dead there and ephron answered abraham saying unto him my lord hearken unto me a piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver what is that betwixt me and thee bury therefore thy dead and abraham hearkened unto ephron and abraham weighed to ephron the silver which he had named in the hearing of the children of heth four hundred shekels of silver current money with the merchant so the field of ephron which was in machpelah which was before mamre the field and the cave which was therein and all the trees that were in the field that were in all the border thereof round about were made sure unto abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of heth before all that went in at the gate of his city and after this abraham buried sarah his wife in the cave of the field of machpelah before mamrethe same is hebronin the land of canaan and the field and the cave that is therein were made sure unto abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the children of heth s and abraham was old well stricken in age and the lord had blessed abraham in all things and abraham said unto his servant the elder of his house that ruled over all that he had put i pray thee thy hand under my thigh and i will make thee swear by the lord the god of heaven and the god of the earth that thou shalt not take a wife for my son of the daughters of the canaanites among whom i dwell but thou shalt go unto my country and to my kindred and take a wife for my son even for isaac and the servant said unto him peradventure the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land must i needs bring thy son back unto the land from whence thou camest and abraham said unto him beware thou that thou bring not my son back thither the lord the god of heaven who took me from my fathers house and from the land of my nativity and who spoke unto me and who swore unto me saying unto thy seed will i give this land he will send his angel before thee and thou shalt take a wife for my son from thence and if the woman be not willing to follow thee then thou shalt be clear from this my oath only thou shalt not bring my son back thither and the servant put his hand under the thigh of abraham his master and swore to him concerning this matter and the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master and departed having all goodly things of his masters in his hand and he arose and went to aramnaharaim unto the city of nahor and he made the camels to kneel down without the city by the well of water at the time of evening the time that women go out to draw water and he said o lord the god of my master abraham send me i pray thee good speed this day and show kindness unto my master abraham behold i stand by the fountain of water and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water so let it come to pass that the damsel to whom i shall say let down thy pitcher i pray thee that i may drink and she shall say drink and i will give thy camels drink also let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant even for isaac and thereby shall i know that thou hast shown kindness unto my master and it came to pass before he had done speaking that behold rebekah came out who was born to bethuel the son of milcah the wife of nahor abrahams brother with her pitcher upon her shoulder and the damsel was very fair to look upon a virgin neither had any man known her and she went down to the fountain and filled her pitcher and came up and the servant ran to meet her and said give me to drink i pray thee a little water of thy pitcher and she said drink my lord and she hastened and let down her pitcher upon her hand and gave him drink and when she had done giving him drink she said i will draw for thy camels also until they have done drinking and she hastened and emptied her pitcher into the trough and ran again unto the well to draw and drew for all his camels and the man looked stedfastly on her holding his peace to know whether the lord had made his journey prosperous or not and it came to pass as the camels had done drinking that the man took a golden ring of half a shekel weight and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold and said whose daughter art thou tell me i pray thee is there room in thy fathers house for us to lodge in and she said unto him i am the daughter of bethuel the son of milcah whom she bore unto nahor she said moreover unto him we have both straw and provender enough and room to lodge in and the man bowed his head and prostrated himself before the lord and he said blessed be the lord the god of my master abraham who hath not forsaken his mercy and his truth toward my master as for me the lord hath led me in the way to the house of my masters brethren and the damsel ran and told her mothers house according to these words and rebekah had a brother and his name was laban and laban ran out unto the man unto the fountain and it came to pass when he saw the ring and the bracelets upon his sisters hands and when he heard the words of rebekah his sister saying thus spoke the man unto me that he came unto the man and behold he stood by the camels at the fountain and he said come in thou blessed of the lord wherefore standest thou without for i have cleared the house and made room for the camels and the man came into the house and he ungirded the camels and he gave straw and provender for the camels and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men that were with him and there was set food before him to eat but he said i will not eat until i have told mine errand and he said speak on and he said i am abrahams servant and the lord hath blessed my master greatly and he is become great and he hath given him flocks and herds and silver and gold and menservants and maidservants and camels and asses and sarah',\n",
       "  ' my masters wife bore a son to my master when she was old and unto him hath he given all that he hath and my master made me swear saying thou shalt not take a wife for my son of the daughters of the canaanites in whose land i dwell but thou shalt go unto my fathers house and to my kindred and take a wife for my son and i said unto my master peradventure the woman will not follow me and he said unto me the lord before whom i walk will send his angel with thee and prosper thy way and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my kindred and of my fathers house then shalt thou be clear from my oath when thou comest to my kindred and if they give her not to thee thou shalt be clear from my oath and i came this day unto the fountain and said o lord the god of my master abraham if now thou do prosper my way which i go behold i stand by the fountain of water and let it come to pass that the maiden that cometh forth to draw to whom i shall say give me i pray thee a little water from thy pitcher to drink and she shall say to me both drink thou and i will also draw for thy camels let the same be the woman whom the lord hath appointed for my masters son and before i had done speaking to my heart behold rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder and she went down unto the fountain and drew and i said unto her let me drink i pray thee and she made haste and let down her pitcher from her shoulder and said drink and i will give thy camels drink also so i drank and she made the camels drink also and i asked her and said whose daughter art thou and she said the daughter of bethuel nahors son whom milcah bore unto him and i put the ring upon her nose and the bracelets upon her hands and i bowed my head and prostrated myself before the lord and blessed the lord the god of my master abraham who had led me in the right way to take my masters brothers daughter for his son and now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master tell me and if not tell me that i may turn to the right hand or to the left then laban and bethuel answered and said the thing proceedeth from the lord we cannot speak unto thee bad or good behold rebekah is before thee take her and go and let her be thy masters sons wife as the lord hath spoken and it came to pass that when abrahams servant heard their words he bowed himself down to the earth unto the lord and the servant brought forth jewels of silver and jewels of gold and raiment and gave them to rebekah he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things and they did eat and drink he and the men that were with him and tarried all night and they rose up in the morning and he said send me away unto my master and her brother and her mother said let the damsel abide with us a few days at the least ten after that she shall go and he said unto them delay me not seeing the lord hath prospered my way send me away that i may go to my master and they said we will call the damsel and inquire at her mouth and they called rebekah and said unto her wilt thou go with this man and she said i will go and they sent away rebekah their sister and her nurse and abrahams servant and his men and they blessed rebekah and said unto her our sister be thou the mother of thousands of ten thousands and let thy seed possess the gate of those that hate them and rebekah arose and her damsels and they rode upon the camels and followed the man and the servant took rebekah and went his way and isaac came from the way of beerlahairoi for he dwelt in the land of the south and isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide and he lifted up his eyes and saw and behold there were camels coming and rebekah lifted up her eyes and when she saw isaac she alighted from the camel and she said unto the servant what man is this that walketh in the field to meet us and the servant said it is my master and she took her veil and covered herself and the servant told isaac all the things that he had done and isaac brought her into his mother sarahs tent and took rebekah and she became his wife and he loved her and isaac was comforted for his mother  and abraham took another wife and her name was keturah and she bore him zimran and jokshan and medan and midian and ishbak and shuah and jokshan begot sheba and dedan and the sons of dedan were asshurim and letushim and leummim and the sons of midian ephah and epher and hanoch and abida and eldaah all these were the children of keturah and abraham gave all that he had unto isaac but unto the sons of the concubines that abraham had abraham gave gifts and he sent them away from isaac his son while he yet lived eastward unto the east country and these are the days of the years of abrahams life which he lived a hundred threescore and fifteen years and abraham expired and died in a good old age an old man and full of years and was gathered to his people and isaac and ishmael his sons buried him in the cave of machpelah in the field of ephron the son of zohar the hittite which is before mamre the field which abraham purchased of the children of heth there was abraham buried and sarah his wife and it came to pass after the death of abraham that god blessed isaac his son and isaac dwelt by beerlahairoi  now these are the generations of ishmael abrahams son whom hagar the egyptian sarahs handmaid bore unto abraham and these are the names of the sons of ishmael by their names according to their generations the firstborn of ishmael nebaioth and kedar and adbeel and mibsam and mishma and dumah and massa hadad and tema jetur naphish and kedem these are the sons of ishmael and these are their names by their villages and by their encampments twelve princes according to their nations and these are the years of the life of ishmael a hundred and thirty and seven years and he expired and died and was gathered unto his people and they dwelt from havilah unto shur that is before egypt as thou goest toward asshur over against all his brethren he did settle  and these are the generations of isaac abrahams son abraham begot isaac and isaac was forty years old when he took rebekah the daughter of bethuel the aramean of paddanaram the sister of laban the aramean to be his wife and isaac entreated the lord for his wife because she was barren and the lord let himself be entreated of him and rebekah his wife conceived and the children struggled together within her and she said if it be so wherefore do i live and she went to inquire of the lord and the lord said unto her two nations are in thy womb and two peoples shall be separated from thy bowels and the one people shall be stronger than the other people and the elder shall serve the younger and when her days to be delivered were fulfilled behold there were twins in her womb and the first came forth ruddy all over like a hairy mantle and they called his name esau and after that came forth his brother and his hand had hold on esaus heel and his name was called jacob and isaac was threescore years old when she bore them and the boys grew and esau was a cunning hunter a man of the field and jacob was a quiet man dwelling in tents now isaac loved esau because he did eat of his venison and rebekah loved jacob and jacob sod pottage and esau came in from the field and he was faint and esau said to jacob let me swallow i pray thee some of this red red pottage for i am faint therefore was his name called edom and jacob said sell me first thy birthright and esau said behold i am at the point to die and what profit shall the birthright do to me and jacob said swear to me first and he swore unto him and he sold his birthright unto jacob and jacob gave esau bread and pottage of lentils and he did eat and drink and rose up and went his way so esau despised his birthright  and there was a famine in the land beside the first famine that was in the days of abraham and isaac went unto abimelech king of the philistines unto gerar and the lord appeared unto him and said go not down unto egypt dwell in the land which i shall tell thee of sojourn in this land and i will be with thee and will bless thee for unto thee and unto thy seed i will give all these lands and i will establish the oath which i swore unto abraham thy father and i will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven and will give unto thy seed all these lands and by thy seed shall all the nations of the earth bless themselves because that abraham hearkened to my voice and kept my charge my commandments my statutes and my laws and isaac dwelt in gerar and the men of the place asked him of his wife and he said she is my sister for he feared to say my wife lest the men of the place should kill me for rebekah because she is fair to look upon and it came to pass when he had been there a long time that abimelech king of the philistines looked out at a window and saw and behold isaac was sporting with rebekah his wife and abimelech called isaac and said behold of a surety she is thy wife and how saidst thou she is my sister and isaac said unto him because i said lest i die because of her and abimelech said what is this thou hast done unto us one of the people might easily have lain with thy wife and thou wouldest have brought guiltiness upon us and abimelech charged all the people saying he that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death and isaac sowed in that land and found in the same year a hundredfold and the lord blessed him and the man waxed great and grew more and more until he became very great and he had possessions of flocks and possessions of he',\n",
       "  'rds and a great household and the philistines envied him now all the wells which his fathers servants had digged in the days of abraham his father the philistines had stopped them and filled them with earth and abimelech said unto isaac go from us for thou art much mightier than we and isaac departed thence and encamped in the valley of gerar and dwelt there and isaac digged again the wells of water which they had digged in the days of abraham his father for the philistines had stopped them after the death of abraham and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them and isaacs servants digged in the valley and found there a well of living water and the herdmen of gerar strove with isaacs herdmen saying the water is ours and he called the name of the well esek because they contended with him and they digged another well and they strove for that also and he called the name of it sitnah and he removed from thence and digged another well and for that they strove not and he called the name of it rehoboth and he said for now the lord hath made room for us and we shall be fruitful in the land and he went up from thence to beersheba and the lord appeared unto him the same night and said i am the god of abraham thy father fear not for i am with thee and will bless thee and multiply thy seed for my servant abrahams sake and he builded an altar there and called upon the name of the lord and pitched his tent there and there isaacs servants digged a well then abimelech went to him from gerar and ahuzzath his friend and phicol the captain of his host and isaac said unto them wherefore are ye come unto me seeing ye hate me and have sent me away from you and they said we saw plainly that the lord was with thee and we said let there now be an oath betwixt us even betwixt us and thee and let us make a covenant with thee that thou wilt do us no hurt as we have not touched thee and as we have done unto thee nothing but good and have sent thee away in peace thou art now the blessed of the lord and he made them a feast and they did eat and drink and they rose up betimes in the morning and swore one to another and isaac sent them away and they departed from him in peace and it came to pass the same day that isaacs servants came and told him concerning the well which they had digged and said unto him we have found water and he called it shibah therefore the name of the city is beersheba unto this day s and when esau was forty years old he took to wife judith the daughter of beeri the hittite and basemath the daughter of elon the hittite and they were a bitterness of spirit unto isaac and to rebekah s and it came to pass that when isaac was old and his eyes were dim so that he could not see he called esau his elder son and said unto him my son and he said unto him here am i and he said behold now i am old i know not the day of my death now therefore take i pray thee thy weapons thy quiver and thy bow and go out to the field and take me venison and make me savoury food such as i love and bring it to me that i may eat that my soul may bless thee before i die and rebekah heard when isaac spoke to esau his son and esau went to the field to hunt for venison and to bring it and rebekah spoke unto jacob her son saying behold i heard thy father speak unto esau thy brother saying bring me venison and make me savoury food that i may eat and bless thee before the lord before my death now therefore my son hearken to my voice according to that which i command thee go now to the flock and fetch me from thence two good kids of the goats and i will make them savoury food for thy father such as he loveth and thou shalt bring it to thy father that he may eat so that he may bless thee before his death and jacob said to rebekah his mother behold esau my brother is a hairy man and i am a smooth man my father peradventure will feel me and i shall seem to him as a mocker and i shall bring a curse upon me and not a blessing and his mother said unto him upon me be thy curse my son only hearken to my voice and go fetch me them and he went and fetched and brought them to his mother and his mother made savoury food such as his father loved and rebekah took the choicest garments of esau her elder son which were with her in the house and put them upon jacob her younger son and she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands and upon the smooth of his neck and she gave the savoury food and the bread which she had prepared into the hand of her son jacob and he came unto his father and said my father and he said here am i who art thou my son and jacob said unto his father i am esau thy firstborn i have done according as thou badest me arise i pray thee sit and eat of my venison that thy soul may bless me and isaac said unto his son how is it that thou hast found it so quickly my son and he said because the lord thy god sent me good speed and isaac said unto jacob come near i pray thee that i may feel thee my son whether thou be my very son esau or not and jacob went near unto isaac his father and he felt him and said the voice is the voice of jacob but the hands are the hands of esau and he discerned him not because his hands were hairy as his brother esaus hands so he blessed him and he said art thou my very son esau and he said i am and he said bring it near to me and i will eat of my sons venison that my soul may bless thee and he brought it near to him and he did eat and he brought him wine and he drank and his father isaac said unto him come near now and kiss me my son and he came near and kissed him and he smelled the smell of his raiment and blessed him and said see the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which the lord hath blessed so god give thee of the dew of heaven and of the fat places of the earth and plenty of corn and wine let peoples serve thee and nations bow down to thee be lord over thy brethren and let thy mothers sons bow down to thee cursed be every one that curseth thee and blessed be every one that blesseth thee and it came to pass as soon as isaac had made an end of blessing jacob and jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of isaac his father that esau his brother came in from his hunting and he also made savoury food and brought it unto his father and he said unto his father let my father arise and eat of his sons venison that thy soul may bless me and isaac his father said unto him who art thou and he said i am thy son thy firstborn esau and isaac trembled very exceedingly and said who then is he that hath taken venison and brought it me and i have eaten of all before thou camest and have blessed him yea and he shall be blessed when esau heard the words of his father he cried with an exceeding great and bitter cry and said unto his father bless me even me also o my father and he said thy brother came with guile and hath taken away thy blessing and he said is not he rightly named jacob for he hath supplanted me these two times he took away my birthright and behold now he hath taken away my blessing and he said hast thou not reserved a blessing for me and isaac answered and said unto esau behold i have made him thy lord and all his brethren have i given to him for servants and with corn and wine have i sustained him and what then shall i do for thee my son and esau said unto his father hast thou but one blessing my father bless me even me also o my father and esau lifted up his voice and wept and isaac his father answered and said unto him behold of the fat places of the earth shall be thy dwelling and of the dew of heaven from above and by thy sword shalt thou live and thou shalt serve thy brother and it shall come to pass when thou shalt break loose that thou shalt shake his yoke from off thy neck and esau hated jacob because of the blessing wherewith his father blessed him and esau said in his heart let the days of mourning for my father be at hand then will i slay my brother jacob and the words of esau her elder son were told to rebekah and she sent and called jacob her younger son and said unto him behold thy brother esau as touching thee doth comfort himself purposing to kill thee now therefore my son hearken to my voice and arise flee thou to laban my brother to haran and tarry with him a few days until thy brothers fury turn away until thy brothers anger turn away from thee and he forget that which thou hast done to him then i will send and fetch thee from thence why should i be bereaved of you both in one day and rebekah said to isaac i am weary of my life because of the daughters of heth if jacob take a wife of the daughters of heth such as these of the daughters of the land what good shall my life do me and isaac called jacob and blessed him and charged him and said unto him thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of canaan arise go to paddanaram to the house of bethuel thy mothers father and take thee a wife from thence of the daughters of laban thy mothers brother and god almighty bless thee and make thee fruitful and multiply thee that thou mayest be a congregation of peoples and give thee the blessing of abraham to thee and to thy seed with thee that thou mayest inherit the land of thy sojournings which god gave unto abraham and isaac sent away jacob and he went to paddanaram unto laban son of bethuel the aramean the brother of rebekah jacobs and esaus mother now esau saw that isaac had blessed jacob and sent him away to paddanaram to take him a wife from thence and that as he blessed him he gave him a charge ',\n",
       "  'saying thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of canaan and that jacob hearkened to his father and his mother and was gone to paddanaram and esau saw that the daughters of canaan pleased not isaac his father so esau went unto ishmael and took unto the wives that he had mahalath the daughter of ishmael abrahams son the sister of nebaioth to be his wife s and jacob went out from beersheba and went toward haran and he lighted upon the place and tarried there all night because the sun was set and he took one of the stones of the place and put it under his head and lay down in that place to sleep and he dreamed and behold a ladder set up on the earth and the top of it reached to heaven and behold the angels of god ascending and descending on it and behold the lord stood beside him and said i am the lord the god of abraham thy father and the god of isaac the land whereon thou liest to thee will i give it and to thy seed and thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth and thou shalt spread abroad to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed and behold i am with thee and will keep thee whithersoever thou goest and will bring thee back into this land for i will not leave thee until i have done that which i have spoken to thee of and jacob awaked out of his sleep and he said surely the lord is in this place and i knew it not and he was afraid and said how full of awe is this place this is none other than the house of god and this is the gate of heaven and jacob rose up early in the morning and took the stone that he had put under his head and set it up for a pillar and poured oil upon the top of it and he called the name of that place bethel but the name of the city was luz at the first and jacob vowed a vow saying if god will be with me and will keep me in this way that i go and will give me bread to eat and raiment to put on so that i come back to my fathers house in peace then shall the lord be my god and this stone which i have set up for a pillar shall be gods house and of all that thou shalt give me i will surely give the tenth unto thee then jacob went on his journey and came to the land of the children of the east and he looked and behold a well in the field and lo three flocks of sheep lying there by itfor out of that well they watered the flocks and the stone upon the wells mouth was great and thither were all the flocks gathered and they rolled the stone from the wells mouth and watered the sheep and put the stone back upon the wells mouth in its place and jacob said unto them my brethren whence are ye and they said of haran are we and he said unto them know ye laban the son of nahor and they said we know him and he said unto them is it well with him and they said it is well and behold rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep and he said lo it is yet high day neither is it time that the cattle should be gathered together water ye the sheep and go and feed them and they said we cannot until all the flocks be gathered together and they roll the stone from the wells mouth then we water the sheep while he was yet speaking with them rachel came with her fathers sheep for she tended them and it came to pass when jacob saw rachel the daughter of laban his mothers brother and the sheep of laban his mothers brother that jacob went near and rolled the stone from the wells mouth and watered the flock of laban his mothers brother and jacob kissed rachel and lifted up his voice and wept and jacob told rachel that he was her fathers brother and that he was rebekahs son and she ran and told her father and it came to pass when laban heard the tidings of jacob his sisters son that he ran to meet him and embraced him and kissed him and brought him to his house and he told laban all these things and laban said to him surely thou art my bone and my flesh and he abode with him the space of a month and laban said unto jacob because thou art my brother shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought tell me what shall thy wages be now laban had two daughters the name of the elder was leah and the name of the younger was rachel and leahs eyes were weak but rachel was of beautiful form and fair to look upon and jacob loved rachel and he said i will serve thee seven years for rachel thy younger daughter and laban said it is better that i give her to thee than that i should give her to another man abide with me and jacob served seven years for rachel and they seemed unto him but a few days for the love he had to her and jacob said unto laban give me my wife for my days are filled that i may go in unto her and laban gathered together all the men of the place and made a feast and it came to pass in the evening that he took leah his daughter and brought her to him and he went in unto her and laban gave zilpah his handmaid unto his daughter leah for a handmaid and it came to pass in the morning that behold it was leah and he said to laban what is this thou hast done unto me did not i serve with thee for rachel wherefore then hast thou beguiled me and laban said it is not so done in our place to give the younger before the firstborn fulfil the week of this one and we will give thee the other also for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years and jacob did so and fulfilled her week and he gave him rachel his daughter to wife and laban gave to rachel his daughter bilhah his handmaid to be her handmaid and he went in also unto rachel and he loved rachel more than leah and served with him yet seven other years and the lord saw that leah was hated and he opened her womb but rachel was barren and leah conceived and bore a son and she called his name reuben for she said because the lord hath looked upon my affliction for now my husband will love me and she conceived again and bore a son and said because the lord hath heard that i am hated he hath therefore given me this son also and she called his name simeon and she conceived again and bore a son and said now this time will my husband be joined unto me because i have borne him three sons therefore was his name called levi and she conceived again and bore a son and she said this time will i praise the lord therefore she called his name judah and she left off bearing and when rachel saw that she bore jacob no children rachel envied her sister and she said unto jacob give me children or else i die and jacobs anger was kindled against rachel and he said am i in gods stead who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb and she said behold my maid bilhah go in unto her that she may bear upon my knees and i also may be builded up through her and she gave him bilhah her handmaid to wife and jacob went in unto her and bilhah conceived and bore jacob a son and rachel said god hath judged me and hath also heard my voice and hath given me a son therefore called she his name dan and bilhah rachels handmaid conceived again and bore jacob a second son and rachel said with mighty wrestlings have i wrestled with my sister and have prevailed and she called his name naphtali when leah saw that she had left off bearing she took zilpah her handmaid and gave her to jacob to wife and zilpah leahs handmaid bore jacob a son and leah said fortune is come and she called his name gad and zilpah leahs handmaid bore jacob a second son and leah said happy am i for the daughters will call me happy and she called his name asher and reuben went in the days of wheat harvest and found mandrakes in the field and brought them unto his mother leah then rachel said to leah give me i pray thee of thy sons mandrakes and she said unto her is it a small matter that thou hast taken away my husband and wouldest thou take away my sons mandrakes also and rachel said therefore he shall lie with thee tonight for thy sons mandrakes and jacob came from the field in the evening and leah went out to meet him and said thou must come in unto me for i have surely hired thee with my sons mandrakes and he lay with her that night and god hearkened unto leah and she conceived and bore jacob a fifth son and leah said god hath given me my hire because i gave my handmaid to my husband and she called his name issachar and leah conceived again and bore a sixth son to jacob and leah said god hath endowed me with a good dowry now will my husband dwell with me because i have borne him six sons and she called his name zebulun and afterwards she bore a daughter and called her name dinah and god remembered rachel and god hearkened to her and opened her womb and she conceived and bore a son and said god hath taken away my reproach and she called his name joseph saying the lord add to me another son and it came to pass when rachel had borne joseph that jacob said unto laban send me away that i may go unto mine own place and to my country give me my wives and my children for whom i have served thee and let me go for thou knowest my service wherewith i have served thee and laban said unto him if now i have found favour in thine eyesi have observed the signs and the lord hath blessed me for thy sake and he said appoint me thy wages and i will give it and he said unto him thou knowest how i have served thee and how thy cattle have fared with me for it was little which thou hadst before i came and it hath increased abundantly and the lord hath blessed thee whithersoever i turned and now when shall i provide for mine own house also and he said what shall i give thee and jacob said thou shalt not g',\n",
       "  'ive me aught if thou wilt do this thing for me i will again feed thy flock and keep it i will pass through all thy flock today removing from thence every speckled and spotted one and every dark one among the sheep and the spotted and speckled among the goats and of such shall be my hire so shall my righteousness witness against me hereafter when thou shalt come to look over my hire that is before thee every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats and dark among the sheep that if found with me shall be counted stolen and laban said behold would it might be according to thy word and he removed that day the hegoats that were streaked and spotted and all the shegoats that were speckled and spotted every one that had white in it and all the dark ones among the sheep and gave them into the hand of his sons and he set three days journey betwixt himself and jacob and jacob fed the rest of labans flocks and jacob took him rods of fresh poplar and of the almond and of the planetree and peeled white streaks in them making the white appear which was in the rods and he set the rods which he had peeled over against the flocks in the gutters in the wateringtroughs where the flocks came to drink and they conceived when they came to drink and the flocks conceived at the sight of the rods and the flocks brought forth streaked speckled and spotted and jacob separated the lambshe also set the faces of the flocks toward the streaked and all the dark in the flock of labanand put his own droves apart and put them not unto labans flock and it came to pass whensoever the stronger of the flock did conceive that jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the flock in the gutters that they might conceive among the rods but when the flock were feeble he put them not in so the feebler were labans and the stronger jacobs and the man increased exceedingly and had large flocks and maidservants and menservants and camels and asses and he heard the words of labans sons saying jacob hath taken away all that was our fathers and of that which was our fathers hath he gotten all this wealth and jacob beheld the countenance of laban and behold it was not toward him as beforetime and the lord said unto jacob return unto the land of thy fathers and to thy kindred and i will be with thee and jacob sent and called rachel and leah to the field unto his flock and said unto them i see your fathers countenance that it is not toward me as beforetime but the god of my father hath been with me and ye know that with all my power i have served your father and your father hath mocked me and changed my wages ten times but god suffered him not to hurt me if he said thus the speckled shall be thy wages then all the flock bore speckled and if he said thus the streaked shall be thy wages then bore all the flock streaked thus god hath taken away the cattle of your father and given them to me and it came to pass at the time that the flock conceived that i lifted up mine eyes and saw in a dream and behold the hegoats which leaped upon the flock were streaked speckled and grizzled and the angel of god said unto me in the dream jacob and i said here am i and he said lift up now thine eyes and see all the hegoats which leap upon the flock are streaked speckled and grizzled for i have seen all that laban doeth unto thee i am the god of bethel where thou didst anoint a pillar where thou didst vow a vow unto me now arise get thee out from this land and return unto the land of thy nativity and rachel and leah answered and said unto him is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our fathers house are we not accounted by him strangers for he hath sold us and hath also quite devoured our price for all the riches which god hath taken away from our father that is ours and our childrens now then whatsoever god hath said unto thee do then jacob rose up and set his sons and his wives upon the camels and he carried away all his cattle and all his substance which he had gathered the cattle of his getting which he had gathered in paddanaram to go to isaac his father unto the land of canaan now laban was gone to shear his sheep and rachel stole the teraphim that were her fathers and jacob outwitted laban the aramean in that he told him not that he fled so he fled with all that he had and he rose up and passed over the river and set his face toward the mountain of gilead and it was told laban on the third day that jacob was fled and he took his brethren with him and pursued after him seven days journey and he overtook him in the mountain of gilead and god came to laban the aramean in a dream of the night and said unto him take heed to thyself that thou speak not to jacob either good or bad and laban came up with jacob now jacob had pitched his tent in the mountain and laban with his brethren pitched in the mountain of gilead and laban said to jacob what hast thou done that thou hast outwitted me and carried away my daughters as though captives of the sword wherefore didst thou flee secretly and outwit me and didst not tell me that i might have sent thee away with mirth and with songs with tabret and with harp and didst not suffer me to kiss my sons and my daughters now hast thou done foolishly it is in the power of my hand to do you hurt but the god of your father spoke unto me yesternight saying take heed to thyself that thou speak not to jacob either good or bad and now that thou art surely gone because thou sore longest after thy fathers house wherefore hast thou stolen my gods and jacob answered and said to laban because i was afraid for i said lest thou shouldest take thy daughters from me by force with whomsoever thou findest thy gods he shall not live before our brethren discern thou what is thine with me and take it to theefor jacob knew not that rachel had stolen them and laban went into jacobs tent and into leahs tent and into the tent of the two maidservants but he found them not and he went out of leahs tent and entered into rachels tent now rachel had taken the teraphim and put them in the saddle of the camel and sat upon them and laban felt about all the tent but found them not and she said to her father let not my lord be angry that i cannot rise up before thee for the manner of women is upon me and he searched but found not the teraphim and jacob was wroth and strove with laban and jacob answered and said to laban what is my trespass what is my sin that thou hast hotly pursued after me whereas thou hast felt about all my stuff what hast thou found of all thy household stuff set it here before my brethren and thy brethren that they may judge betwixt us two these twenty years have i been with thee thy ewes and thy shegoats have not cast their young and the rams of thy flocks have i not eaten that which was torn of beasts i brought not unto thee i bore the loss of it of my hand didst thou require it whether stolen by day or stolen by night thus i was in the day the drought consumed me and the frost by night and my sleep fled from mine eyes these twenty years have i been in thy house i served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters and six years for thy flock and thou hast changed my wages ten times except the god of my father the god of abraham and the fear of isaac had been on my side surely now hadst thou sent me away empty god hath seen mine affliction and the labour of my hands and gave judgment yesternight and laban answered and said unto jacob the daughters are my daughters and the children are my children and the flocks are my flocks and all that thou seest is mine and what can i do this day for these my daughters or for their children whom they have borne and now come let us make a covenant i and thou and let it be for a witness between me and thee and jacob took a stone and set it up for a pillar and jacob said unto his brethren gather stones and they took stones and made a heap and they did eat there by the heap and laban called it jegarsahadutha but jacob called it galeed and laban said this heap is witness between me and thee this day therefore was the name of it called galeed and mizpah for he said the lord watch between me and thee when we are absent one from another if thou shalt afflict my daughters and if thou shalt take wives beside my daughters no man being with us see god is witness betwixt me and thee and laban said to jacob behold this heap and behold the pillar which i have set up betwixt me and thee this heap be witness and the pillar be witness that i will not pass over this heap to thee and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar unto me for harm the god of abraham and the god of nahor the god of their father judge betwixt us and jacob swore by the fear of his father isaac and jacob offered a sacrifice in the mountain and called his brethren to eat bread and they did eat bread and tarried all night in the mountain and early in the morning laban rose up and kissed his sons and his daughters and blessed them and laban departed and returned unto his place and jacob went on his way and the angels of god met him and jacob said when he saw them this is gods camp and he called the name of that place mahanaim  and jacob sent messengers before him to esau his brother unto the land of seir the field of edom and he commanded them saying thus shall ye say unto my lord esau thus saith thy servant jacob i have sojourned with laban and stayed until now and i have oxen and asses and flocks and menservants and maidservants and i have sent to tell my lord that i may find favour',\n",
       "  ' in thy sight and the messengers returned to jacob saying we came to thy brother esau and moreover he cometh to meet thee and four hundred men with him then jacob was greatly afraid and was distressed and he divided the people that was with him and the flocks and the herds and the camels into two camps and he said if esau come to the one camp and smite it then the camp which is left shall escape and jacob said o god of my father abraham and god of my father isaac o lord who saidst unto me return unto thy country and to thy kindred and i will do thee good i am not worthy of all the mercies and of all the truth which thou hast shown unto thy servant for with my staff i passed over this jordan and now i am become two camps deliver me i pray thee from the hand of my brother from the hand of esau for i fear him lest he come and smite me the mother with the children and thou saidst i will surely do thee good and make thy seed as the sand of the sea which cannot be numbered for multitude and he lodged there that night and took of that which he had with him a present for esau his brother two hundred shegoats and twenty hegoats two hundred ewes and twenty rams thirty milch camels and their colts forty kine and ten bulls twenty sheasses and ten foals and he delivered them into the hand of his servants every drove by itself and said unto his servants pass over before me and put a space betwixt drove and drove and he commanded the foremost saying when esau my brother meeteth thee and asketh thee saying whose art thou and whither goest thou and whose are these before thee then thou shalt say they are thy servant jacobs it is a present sent unto my lord even unto esau and behold he also is behind us and he commanded also the second and the third and all that followed the droves saying in this manner shall ye speak unto esau when ye find him and ye shall say moreover behold thy servant jacob is behind us for he said i will appease him with the present that goeth before me and afterward i will see his face peradventure he will accept me so the present passed over before him and he himself lodged that night in the camp and he rose up that night and took his two wives and his two handmaids and his eleven children and passed over the ford of the jabbok and he took them and sent them over the stream and sent over that which he had and jacob was left alone and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day and when he saw that he prevailed not against him he touched the hollow of his thigh and the hollow of jacobs thigh was strained as he wrestled with him and he said let me go for the day breaketh and he said i will not let thee go except thou bless me and he said unto him what is thy name and he said jacob and he said thy name shall be called no more jacob but israel for thou hast striven with god and with men and hast prevailed and jacob asked him and said tell me i pray thee thy name and he said wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name and he blessed him there and jacob called the name of the place peniel for i have seen god face to face and my life is preserved and the sun rose upon him as he passed over peniel and he limped upon his thigh therefore the children of israel eat not the sinew of the thighvein which is upon the hollow of the thigh unto this day because he touched the hollow of jacobs thigh even in the sinew of the thighvein and jacob lifted up his eyes and looked and behold esau came and with him four hundred men and he divided the children unto leah and unto rachel and unto the two handmaids and he put the handmaids and their children foremost and leah and her children after and rachel and joseph hindermost and he himself passed over before them and bowed himself to the ground seven times until he came near to his brother and esau ran to meet him and embraced him and fell on his neck and kissed him and they wept and he lifted up his eyes and saw the women and the children and said who are these with thee and he said the children whom god hath graciously given thy servant then the handmaids came near they and their children and they bowed down and leah also and her children came near and bowed down and after came joseph near and rachel and they bowed down and he said what meanest thou by all this camp which i met and he said to find favour in the sight of my lord and esau said i have enough my brother let that which thou hast be thine and jacob said nay i pray thee if now i have found favour in thy sight then receive my present at my hand forasmuch as i have seen thy face as one seeth the face of god and thou wast pleased with me take i pray thee my gift that is brought to thee because god hath dealt graciously with me and because i have enough and he urged him and he took it and he said let us take our journey and let us go and i will go before thee and he said unto him my lord knoweth that the children are tender and that the flocks and herds giving suck are a care to me and if they overdrive them one day all the flocks will die let my lord i pray thee pass over before his servant and i will journey on gently according to the pace of the cattle that are before me and according to the pace of the children until i come unto my lord unto seir and esau said let me now leave with thee some of the folk that are with me and he said what needeth it let me find favour in the sight of my lord so esau returned that day on his way unto seir and jacob journeyed to succoth and built him a house and made booths for his cattle therefore the name of the place is called succoth s and jacob came in peace to the city of shechem which is in the land of canaan when he came from paddanaram and encamped before the city and he bought the parcel of ground where he had spread his tent at the hand of the children of hamor shechems father for a hundred pieces of money and he erected there an altar and called it eleloheisrael s and dinah the daughter of leah whom she had borne unto jacob went out to see the daughters of the land and shechem the son of hamor the hivite the prince of the land saw her and he took her and lay with her and humbled her and his soul did cleave unto dinah the daughter of jacob and he loved the damsel and spoke comfortingly unto the damsel and shechem spoke unto his father hamor saying get me this damsel to wife now jacob heard that he had defiled dinah his daughter and his sons were with his cattle in the field and jacob held his peace until they came and hamor the father of shechem went out unto jacob to speak with him and the sons of jacob came in from the field when they heard it and the men were grieved and they were very wroth because he had wrought a vile deed in israel in lying with jacobs daughter which thing ought not to be done and hamor spoke with them saying the soul of my son shechem longeth for your daughter i pray you give her unto him to wife and make ye marriages with us give your daughters unto us and take our daughters unto you and ye shall dwell with us and the land shall be before you dwell and trade ye therein and get you possessions therein and shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren let me find favour in your eyes and what ye shall say unto me i will give ask me never so much dowry and gift and i will give according as ye shall say unto me but give me the damsel to wife and the sons of jacob answered shechem and hamor his father with guile and spoke because he had defiled dinah their sister and said unto them we cannot do this thing to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised for that were a reproach unto us only on this condition will we consent unto you if ye will be as we are that every male of you be circumcised then will we give our daughters unto you and we will take your daughters to us and we will dwell with you and we will become one people but if ye will not hearken unto us to be circumcised then will we take our daughter and we will be gone and their words pleased hamor and shechem hamors son and the young man deferred not to do the thing because he had delight in jacobs daughter and he was honoured above all the house of his father and hamor and shechem his son came unto the gate of their city and spoke with the men of their city saying these men are peaceable with us therefore let them dwell in the land and trade therein for behold the land is large enough for them let us take their daughters to us for wives and let us give them our daughters only on this condition will the men consent unto us to dwell with us to become one people if every male among us be circumcised as they are circumcised shall not their cattle and their substance and all their beasts be ours only let us consent unto them and they will dwell with us and unto hamor and unto shechem his son hearkened all that went out of the gate of his city and every male was circumcised all that went out of the gate of his city and it came to pass on the third day when they were in pain that two of the sons of jacob simeon and levi dinahs brethren took each man his sword and came upon the city unawares and slew all the males and they slew hamor and shechem his son with the edge of the sword and took dinah out of shechems house and went forth the sons of jacob came upon the slain and spoiled the city because they had defiled their sister they took their flocks and their herds and their asses and that which was in the city and that which was in the field and all their wealth and all their little ones and their wives took they captiv',\n",
       "  'e and spoiled even all that was in the house and jacob said to simeon and levi ye have troubled me to make me odious unto the inhabitants of the land even unto the canaanites and the perizzites and i being few in number they will gather themselves together against me and smite me and i shall be destroyed i and my house and they said should one deal with our sister as with a harlot  and god said unto jacob arise go up to bethel and dwell there and make there an altar unto god who appeared unto thee when thou didst flee from the face of esau thy brother then jacob said unto his household and to all that were with him put away the strange gods that are among you and purify yourselves and change your garments and let us arise and go up to bethel and i will make there an altar unto god who answered me in the day of my distress and was with me in the way which i went and they gave unto jacob all the foreign gods which were in their hand and the rings which were in their ears and jacob hid them under the terebinth which was by shechem and they journeyed and a terror of god was upon the cities that were round about them and they did not pursue after the sons of jacob so jacob came to luz which is in the land of canaanthe same is bethelhe and all the people that were with him and he built there an altar and called the place elbethel because there god was revealed unto him when he fled from the face of his brother and deborah rebekahs nurse died and she was buried below bethel under the oak and the name of it was called allonbacuth  and god appeared unto jacob again when he came from paddanaram and blessed him and god said unto him thy name is jacob thy name shall not be called any more jacob but israel shall be thy name and he called his name israel and god said unto him i am god almighty be fruitful and multiply a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee and kings shall come out of thy loins and the land which i gave unto abraham and isaac to thee i will give it and to thy seed after thee will i give the land and god went up from him in the place where he spoke with him and jacob set up a pillar in the place where he spoke with him a pillar of stone and he poured out a drinkoffering thereon and poured oil thereon and jacob called the name of the place where god spoke with him bethel and they journeyed from bethel and there was still some

the father of the edomites  and jacob dwelt in the land of his fathers sojournings in the land of canaan these are the generations of jacob joseph being seventeen years old was feeding the flock with his brethren being still a lad even with the sons of bilhah and with the sons of zilpah his fathers wives and joseph brought evil report of them unto their father now israel loved joseph more than all his children because he was the son of his old age and he made him a coat of many colours and when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren they hated him and could not speak peaceably unto him and joseph dreamed a dream and he told it to his brethren and they hated him yet the more and he said unto them hear i pray you this dream which i have dreamed for behold we were binding sheaves in the field and lo my sheaf arose and also stood upright and behold your sheaves came round about and bowed down to my sheaf and his brethren said to him shalt thou indeed reign over us or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us and they hated him yet the more for his dreams and for his words and he dreamed yet another dream and told it to his brethren and said behold i ha',\n",
       "  've dreamed yet a dream and behold the sun and the moon and eleven stars bowed down to me and he told it to his father and to his brethren and his father rebuked him and said unto him what is this dream that thou hast dreamed shall i and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down to thee to the earth and his brethren envied him but his father kept the saying in mind and his brethren went to feed their fathers flock in shechem and israel said unto joseph do not thy brethren feed the flock in shechem come and i will send thee unto them and he said to him here am i and he said to him go now see whether it is well with thy brethren and well with the flock and bring me back word so he sent him out of the vale of hebron and he came to shechem and a certain man found him and behold he was wandering in the field and the man asked him saying what seekest thou and he said i seek my brethren tell me i pray thee where they are feeding the flock and the man said they are departed hence for i heard them say let us go to dothan and joseph went after his brethren and found them in dothan and they saw him afar off and before he came near unto them they conspired against him to slay him and they said one to another behold this dreamer cometh come now therefore and let us slay him and cast him into one of the pits and we will say an evil beast hath devoured him and we shall see what will become of his dreams and reuben heard it and delivered him out of their hand and said let us not take his life and reuben said unto them shed no blood cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness but lay no hand upon himthat he might deliver him out of their hand to restore him to his father and it came to pass when joseph was come unto his brethren that they stripped joseph of his coat the coat of many colours that was on him and they took him and cast him into the pitand the pit was empty there was no water in it and they sat down to eat bread and they lifted up their eyes and looked and behold a caravan of ishmaelites came from gilead with their camels bearing spicery and balm and ladanum going to carry it down to egypt and judah said unto his brethren what profit is it if we slay our brother and conceal his blood come and let us sell him to the ishmaelites and let not our hand be upon him for he is our brother our flesh and his brethren hearkened unto him and there passed by midianites merchantmen and they drew and lifted up joseph out of the pit and sold joseph to the ishmaelites for twenty shekels of silver and they brought joseph into egypt and reuben returned unto the pit and behold joseph was not in the pit and he rent his clothes and he returned unto his brethren and said the child is not and as for me whither shall i go and they took josephs coat and killed a hegoat and dipped the coat in the blood and they sent the coat of many colours and they brought it to their father and said this have we found know now whether it is thy sons coat or not and he knew it and said it is my sons coat an evil beast hath devoured him joseph is without doubt torn in pieces and jacob rent his garments and put sackcloth upon his loins and mourned for his son many days and all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him but he refused to be comforted and he said nay but i will go down to the grave to my son mourning and his father wept for him and the midianites sold him into egypt unto potiphar an officer of pharaohs the captain of the guard  and it came to pass at that time that judah went down from his brethren and turned in to a certain adullamite whose name was hirah and judah saw there a daughter of a certain canaanite whose name was shua and he took her and went in unto her and she conceived and bore a son and he called his name er and she conceived again and bore a son and she called his name onan and she yet again bore a son and called his name shelah and he was at chezib when she bore him and judah took a wife for er his firstborn and her name was tamar and er judahs firstborn was wicked in the sight of the lord and the lord slew him and judah said unto onan go in unto thy brothers wife and perform the duty of a husbands brother unto her and raise up seed to thy brother and onan knew that the seed would not be his and it came to pass when he went in unto his brothers wife that he spilled it on the ground lest he should give seed to his brother and the thing which he did was evil in the sight of the lord and he slew him also then said judah to tamar his daughterinlaw remain a widow in thy fathers house till shelah my son be grown up for he said lest he also die like his brethren and tamar went and dwelt in her fathers house and in process of time shuas daughter the wife of judah died and judah was comforted and went up unto his sheepshearers to timnah he and his friend hirah the adullamite and it was told tamar saying behold thy fatherinlaw goeth up to timnah to shear his sheep and she put off from her the garments of her widowhood and covered herself with her veil and wrapped herself and sat in the entrance of enaim which is by the way to timnah for she saw that shelah was grown up and she was not given unto him to wife when judah saw her he thought her to be a harlot for she had covered her face and he turned unto her by the way and said come i pray thee let me come in unto thee for he knew not that she was his daughterinlaw and she said what wilt thou give me that thou mayest come in unto me and he said i will send thee a kid of the goats from the flock and she said wilt thou give me a pledge till thou send it and he said what pledge shall i give thee and she said thy signet and thy cord and thy staff that is in thy hand and he gave them to her and came in unto her and she conceived by him and she arose and went away and put off her veil from her and put on the garments of her widowhood and judah sent the kid of the goats by the hand of his friend the adullamite to receive the pledge from the womans hand but he found her not then he asked the men of her place saying where is the harlot that was at enaim by the wayside and they said there hath been no harlot here and he returned to judah and said i have not found her and also the men of the place said there hath been no harlot here and judah said let her take it lest we be put to shame behold i sent this kid and thou hast not found her and it came to pass about three months after that it was told judah saying tamar thy daughterinlaw hath played the harlot and moreover behold she is with child by harlotry and judah said bring her forth and let her be burnt when she was brought forth she sent to her fatherinlaw saying by the man whose these are am i with child and she said discern i pray thee whose are these the signet and the cords and the staff and judah acknowledged them and said she is more righteous than i forasmuch as i gave her not to shelah my son and he knew her again no more and it came to pass in the time of her travail that behold twins were in her womb and it came to pass when she travailed that one put out a hand and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread saying this came out first and it came to pass as he drew back his hand that behold his brother came out and she said wherefore hast thou made a breach for thyself therefore his name was called perez and afterward came out his brother that had the scarlet thread upon his hand and his name was called zerah s and joseph was brought down to egypt and potiphar an officer of pharaohs the captain of the guard an egyptian bought him of the hand of the ishmaelites that had brought him down thither and the lord was with joseph and he was a prosperous man and he was in the house of his master the egyptian and his master saw that the lord was with him and that the lord made all that he did to prosper in his hand and joseph found favour in his sight and he ministered unto him and he appointed him overseer over his house and all that he had he put into his hand and it came to pass from the time that he appointed him overseer in his house and over all that he had that the lord blessed the egyptians house for josephs sake and the blessing of the lord was upon all that he had in the house and in the field and he left all that he had in josephs hand and having him he knew not aught save the bread which he did eat and joseph was of beautiful form and fair to look upon and it came to pass after these things that his masters wife cast her eyes upon joseph and she said lie with me but he refused and said unto his masters wife behold my master having me knoweth not what is in the house and he hath put all that he hath into my hand he is not greater in this house than i neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee because thou art his wife how then can i do this great wickedness and sin against god and it came to pass as she spoke to joseph day by day that he hearkened not unto her to lie by her or to be with her and it came to pass on a certain day when he went into the house to do his work and there was none of the men of the house there within that she caught him by his garment saying lie with me and he left his garment in her hand and fled and got him out and it came to pass when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand and was fled forth that she called unto the men of her house and spoke unto them saying see he hath brought in a hebrew unto us to mock us he came in unto me to lie with me and i cried with a loud voice and it came to p',\n",
       "  'ass when he heard that i lifted up my voice and cried that he left his garment by me and fled and got him out and she laid up his garment by her until his master came home and she spoke unto him according to these words saying the hebrew servant whom thou hast brought unto us came in unto me to mock me and it came to pass as i lifted up my voice and cried that he left his garment by me and fled out and it came to pass when his master heard the words of his wife which she spoke unto him saying after this manner did thy servant to me that his wrath was kindled and josephs master took him and put him into the prison the place where the kings prisoners were bound and he was there in the prison but the lord was with joseph and showed kindness unto him and gave him favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison and the keeper of the prison committed to josephs hand all the prisoners that were in the prison and whatsoever they did there he was the doer of it the keeper of the prison looked not to any thing that was under his hand because the lord was with him and that which he did the lord made it to prosper  and it came to pass after these things that the butler of the king of egypt and his baker offended their lord the king of egypt and pharaoh was wroth against his two officers against the chief of the butlers and against the chief of the bakers and he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard into the prison the place where joseph was bound and the captain of the guard charged joseph to be with them and he ministered unto them and they continued a season in ward and they dreamed a dream both of them each man his dream in one night each man according to the interpretation of his dream the butler and the baker of the king of egypt who were bound in the prison and joseph came in unto them in the morning and saw them and behold they were sad and he asked pharaohs officers that were with him in the ward of his masters house saying wherefore look ye so sad today and they said unto him we have dreamed a dream and there is none that can interpret it and joseph said unto them do not interpretations belong to god tell it me i pray you and the chief butler told his dream to joseph and said to him in my dream behold a vine was before me and in the vine were three branches and as it was budding its blossoms shot forth and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes and pharaohs cup was in my hand and i took the grapes and pressed them into pharaohs cup and i gave the cup into pharaohs hand and joseph said unto him this is the interpretation of it the three branches are three days within yet three days shall pharaoh lift up thy head and restore thee unto thine office and thou shalt give pharaohs cup into his hand after the former manner when thou wast his butler but have me in thy remembrance when it shall be well with thee and show kindness i pray thee unto me and make mention of me unto pharaoh and bring me out of this house for indeed i was stolen away out of the land of the hebrews and here also have i done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon when the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good he said unto joseph i also saw in my dream and behold three baskets of white bread were on my head and in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of baked food for pharaoh and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my head and joseph answered and said this is the interpretation thereof the three baskets are three days within yet three days shall pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee and shall hang thee on a tree and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee and it came to pass the third day which was pharaohs birthday that he made a feast unto all his servants and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and the head of the chief baker among his servants and he restored the chief butler back unto his butlership and he gave the cup into pharaohs hand but he hanged the chief baker as joseph had interpreted to them yet did not the chief butler remember joseph but forgot him  and it came to pass at the end of two full years that pharaoh dreamed and behold he stood by the river and behold there came up out of the river seven kine wellfavoured and fatfleshed and they fed in the reedgrass and behold seven other kine came up after them out of the river ill favoured and leanfleshed and stood by the other kine upon the brink of the river and the illfavoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven wellfavoured and fat kine so pharaoh awoke and he slept and dreamed a second time and behold seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk rank and good and behold seven ears thin and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them and the thin ears swallowed up the seven rank and full ears and pharaoh awoke and behold it was a dream and it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled and he sent and called for all the magicians of egypt and all the wise men thereof and pharaoh told them his dream but there was none that could interpret them unto pharaoh then spoke the chief butler unto pharaoh saying i make mention of my faults this day pharaoh was wroth with his servants and put me in the ward of the house of the captain of the guard me and the chief baker and we dreamed a dream in one night i and he we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream and there was with us there a young man a hebrew servant to the captain of the guard and we told him and he interpreted to us our dreams to each man according to his dream he did interpret and it came to pass as he interpreted to us so it was i was restored unto mine office and he was hanged then pharaoh sent and called joseph and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon and he shaved himself and changed his raiment and came in unto pharaoh and pharaoh said unto joseph i have dreamed a dream and there is none that can interpret it and i have heard say of thee that when thou hearest a dream thou canst interpret it and joseph answered pharaoh saying it is not in me god will give pharaoh an answer of peace and pharaoh spoke unto joseph in my dream behold i stood upon the brink of the river and behold there came up out of the river seven kine fatfleshed and wellfavoured and they fed in the reedgrass and behold seven other kine came up after them poor and very illfavoured and leanfleshed such as i never saw in all the land of egypt for badness and the lean and illfavoured kine did eat up the first seven fat kine and when they had eaten them up it could not be known that they had eaten them but they were still illfavoured as at the beginning so i awoke and i saw in my dream and behold seven ears came up upon one stalk full and good and behold seven ears withered thin and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them and the thin ears swallowed up the seven good ears and i told it unto the magicians but there was none that could declare it to me and joseph said unto pharaoh the dream of pharaoh is one what god is about to do he hath declared unto pharaoh the seven good kine are seven years and the seven good ears are seven years the dream is one and the seven lean and illfavoured kine that came up after them are seven years and also the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind they shall be seven years of famine that is the thing which i spoke unto pharaoh what god is about to do he hath shown unto pharaoh behold there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of egypt and there shall arise after them seven years of famine and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of egypt and the famine shall consume the land and the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine which followeth for it shall be very grievous and for that the dream was doubled unto pharaoh twice it is because the thing is established by god and god will shortly bring it to pass now therefore let pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise and set him over the land of egypt let pharaoh do this and let him appoint overseers over the land and take up the fifth part of the land of egypt in the seven years of plenty and let them gather all the food of these good years that come and lay up corn under the hand of pharaoh for food in the cities and let them keep it and the food shall be for a store to the land against the seven years of famine which shall be in the land of egypt that the land perish not through the famine and the thing was good in the eyes of pharaoh and in the eyes of all his servants and pharaoh said unto his servants can we find such a one as this a man in whom the spirit of god is and pharaoh said unto joseph forasmuch as god hath shown thee all this there is none so discreet and wise as thou thou shalt be over my house and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled only in the throne will i be greater than thou and pharaoh said unto joseph see i have set thee over all the land of egypt and pharaoh took off his signet ring from his hand and put it upon josephs hand and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen and put a gold chain about his neck and he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had and they cried before him abrech and he set him over all the land of egypt and pharaoh said unto joseph i am pharaoh and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or his foot in all the land of egypt and pharaoh called josephs name zaphenathpaneah and he gave him to wife asenath the daughter of potiphera priest of on and joseph went out over th',\n",
       "  'e land of egypt and joseph was thirty years old when he stood before pharaoh king of egyptand joseph went out from the presence of pharaoh and went throughout all the land of egypt and in the seven years of plenty the earth brought forth in heaps and he gathered up all the food of the seven years which were in the land of egypt and laid up the food in the cities the food of the field which was round about every city laid he up in the same and joseph laid up corn as the sand of the sea very much until they left off numbering for it was without number and unto joseph were born two sons before the year of famine came whom asenath the daughter of potiphera priest of on bore unto him and joseph called the name of the firstborn manasseh for god hath made me forget all my toil and all my fathers house and the name of the second called he ephraim for god hath made me fruitful in the land of my affliction and the seven years of plenty that was in the land of egypt came to an end and the seven years of famine began to come according as joseph had said and there was famine in all lands but in all the land of egypt there was bread and when all the land of egypt was famished the people cried to pharaoh for bread and pharaoh said unto all the egyptians go unto joseph what he saith to you do and the famine was over all the face of the earth and joseph opened all the storehouses and sold unto the egyptians and the famine was sore in the land of egypt and all countries came into egypt to joseph to buy corn because the famine was sore in all the earth now jacob saw that there was corn in egypt and jacob said unto his sons why do ye look one upon another and he said behold i have heard that there is corn in egypt get you down thither and buy for us from thence that we may live and not die and josephs ten brethren went down to buy corn from egypt but benjamin josephs brother jacob sent not with his brethren for he said lest peradventure harm befall him and the sons of israel came to buy among those that came for the famine was in the land of canaan and joseph was the governor over the land he it was that sold to all the people of the land and josephs brethren came and bowed down to him with their faces to the earth and joseph saw his brethren and he knew them but made himself strange unto them and spoke roughly with them and he said unto them whence come ye and they said from the land of canaan to buy food and joseph knew his brethren but they knew him not and joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them and said unto them ye are spies to see the nakedness of the land ye are come and they said unto him nay my lord but to buy food are thy servants come we are all one mans sons we are upright men thy servants are no spies and he said unto them nay but to see the nakedness of the land ye are come and they said we thy servants are twelve brethren the sons of one man in the land of canaan and behold the youngest is this day with our father and one is not and joseph said unto them that is it that i spoke unto you saying ye are spies hereby ye shall be proved as pharaoh liveth ye shall not go forth hence except your youngest brother come hither send one of you and let him fetch your brother and ye shall be bound that your words may be proved whether there be truth in you or else as pharaoh liveth surely ye are spies and he put them all together into ward three days and joseph said unto them the third day this do and live for i fear god if ye be upright men let one of your brethren be bound in your prisonhouse but go ye carry corn for the famine of your houses and bring your youngest brother unto me so shall your words be verified and ye shall not die and they did so and they said one to another we are verily guilty concerning our brother in that we saw the distress of his soul when he besought us and we would not hear therefore is this distress come upon us and reuben answered them saying spoke i not unto you saying do not sin against the child and ye would not hear therefore also behold his blood is required and they knew not that joseph understood them for the interpreter was between them and he turned himself about from them and wept and he returned to them and spoke to them and took simeon from among them and bound him before their eyes then joseph commanded to fill their vessels with corn and to restore every mans money into his sack and to give them provision for the way and thus was it done unto them and they laded their asses with their corn and departed thence and as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the lodgingplace he espied his money and behold it was in the mouth of his sack and he said unto his brethren my money is restored and lo it is even in my sack and their heart failed them and they turned trembling one to another saying what is this that god hath done unto us and they came unto jacob their father unto the land of canaan and told him all that had befallen them saying the man the lord of the land spoke roughly with us and took us for spies of the country and we said unto him we are upright men we are no spies we are twelve brethren sons of our father one is not and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of canaan and the man the lord of the land said unto us hereby shall i know that ye are upright men leave one of your brethren with me and take corn for the famine of your houses and go your way and bring your youngest brother unto me then shall i know that ye are no spies but that ye are upright men so will i deliver you your brother and ye shall traffic in the land and it came to pass as they emptied their sacks that behold every mans bundle of money was in his sack and when they and their father saw their bundles of money they were afraid and jacob their father said unto them me have ye bereaved of my children joseph is not and simeon is not and ye will take benjamin away upon me are all these things come and reuben spoke unto his father saying thou shalt slay my two sons if i bring him not to thee deliver him into my hand and i will bring him back to thee and he said my son shall not go down with you for his brother is dead and he only is left if harm befall him by the way in which ye go then will ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave and the famine was sore in the land and it came to pass when they had eaten up the corn which they had brought out of egypt that their father said unto them go again buy us a little food and judah spoke unto him saying the man did earnestly forewarn us saying ye shall not see my face except your brother be with you if thou wilt send our brother with us we will go down and buy thee food but if thou wilt not send him we will not go down for the man said unto us ye shall not see my face except your brother be with you and israel said wherefore dealt ye so ill with me as to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother and they said the man asked straitly concerning ourselves and concerning our kindred saying is your father yet alive have ye another brother and we told him according to the tenor of these words could we in any wise know that he would say bring your brother down and judah said unto israel his father send the lad with me and we will arise and go that we may live and not die both we and thou and also our little ones i will be surety for him of my hand shalt thou require him if i bring him not unto thee and set him before thee then let me bear the blame for ever for except we had lingered surely we had now returned a second time and their father israel said unto them if it be so now do this take of the choice fruits of the land in your vessels and carry down the man a present a little balm and a little honey spicery and ladanum nuts and almonds and take double money in your hand and the money that was returned in the mouth of your sacks carry back in your hand peradventure it was an oversight take also your brother and arise go again unto the man and god almighty give you mercy before the man that he may release unto you your other brother and benjamin and as for me if i be bereaved of my children i am bereaved and the men took that present and they took double money in their hand and benjamin and rose up and went down to egypt and stood before joseph and when joseph saw benjamin with them he said to the steward of his house bring the men into the house and kill the beasts and prepare the meat for the men shall dine with me at noon and the man did as joseph bade and the man brought the men into josephs house and the men were afraid because they were brought into josephs house and they said because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in that he may seek occasion against us and fall upon us and take us for bondmen and our asses and they came near to the steward of josephs house and they spoke unto him at the door of the house and said oh my lord we came indeed down at the first time to buy food and it came to pass when we came to the lodgingplace that we opened our sacks and behold every mans money was in the mouth of his sack our money in full weight and we have brought it back in our hand and other money have we brought down in our hand to buy food we know not who put our money in our sacks and he said peace be to you fear not your god and the god of your father hath given you treasure in your sacks i had your money and he brought simeon out unto them and the man brought the men into josephs house and gave them water and',\n",
       "  ' they washed their feet and he gave their asses provender and they made ready the present against josephs coming at noon for they heard that they should eat bread there and when joseph came home they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house and bowed down to him to the earth and he asked them of their welfare and said is your father well the old man of whom ye spoke is he yet alive and they said thy servant our father is well he is yet alive and they bowed the head and made obeisance and he lifted up his eyes and saw benjamin his brother his mothers son and said is this your youngest brother of whom ye spoke unto me and he said god be gracious unto thee my son and joseph made haste for his heart yearned toward his brother and he sought where to weep and he entered into his chamber and wept there and he washed his face and came out and he refrained himself and said set on bread and they set on for him by himself and for them by themselves and for the egyptians that did eat with him by themselves because the egyptians might not eat bread with the hebrews for that is an abomination unto the egyptians and they sat before him the firstborn according to his birthright and the youngest according to his youth and the men marvelled one with another and portions were taken unto them from before him but benjamins portion was five times so much as any of theirs and they drank and were merry with him and he commanded the steward of his house saying fill the mens sacks with food as much as they can carry and put every mans money in his sacks mouth and put my goblet the silver goblet in the sacks mouth of the youngest and his corn money and he did according to the word that joseph had spoken as soon as the morning was light the men were sent away they and their asses and when they were gone out of the city and were not yet far off joseph said unto his steward up follow after the men and when thou dost overtake them say unto them wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good is not this it in which my lord drinketh and whereby he indeed divineth ye have done evil in so doing and he overtook them and he spoke unto them these words and they said unto him wherefore speaketh my lord such words as these far be it from thy servants that they should do such a thing behold the money which we found in our sacks mouths we brought back unto thee out of the land of canaan how then should we steal out of thy lords house silver or gold with whomsoever of thy servants it be found let him die and we also will be my lords bondmen and he said now also let it be according unto your words he with whom it is found shall be my bondman and ye shall be blameless then they hastened and took down every man his sack to the ground and opened every man his sack and he searched beginning at the eldest and leaving off at the youngest and the goblet was found in benjamins sack and they rent their clothes and laded every man his ass and returned to the city and judah and his brethren came to josephs house and he was yet there and they fell before him on the ground and joseph said unto them what deed is this that ye have done know ye not that such a man as i will indeed divine and judah said what shall we say unto my lord what shall we speak or how shall we clear ourselves god hath found out the iniquity of thy servants behold we are my lords bondmen both we and he also in whose hand the cup is found and he said far be it from me that i should do so the man in whose hand the goblet is found he shall be my bondman but as for you get you up in peace unto your father s then judah came near unto him and said oh my lord let thy servant i pray thee speak a word in my lords ears and let not thine anger burn against thy servant for thou art even as pharaoh my lord asked his servants saying have ye a father or a brother and we said unto my lord we have a father an old man and a child of his old age a little one and his brother is dead and he alone is left of his mother and his father loveth him and thou saidst unto thy servants bring him down unto me that i may set mine eyes upon him and we said unto my lord the lad cannot leave his father for if he should leave his father his father would die and thou saidst unto thy servants except your youngest brother come down with you ye shall see my face no more and it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father we told him the words of my lord and our father said go again buy us a little food and we said we cannot go down if our youngest brother be with us then will we go down for we may not see the mans face except our youngest brother be with us and thy servant my father said unto us ye know that my wife bore me two sons and the one went out from me and i said surely he is torn in pieces and i have not seen him since and if ye take this one also from me and harm befall him ye will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave now therefore when i come to thy servant my father and the lad is not with us seeing that his soul is bound up with the lads soul it will come to pass when he seeth that the lad is not with us that he will die and thy servants will bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave for thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father saying if i bring him not unto thee then shall i bear the blame to my father for ever now therefore let thy servant i pray thee abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord and let the lad go up with his brethren for how shall i go up to my father if the lad be not with me lest i look upon the evil that shall come on my father then joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him and he cried cause every man to go out from me and there stood no man with him while joseph made himself known unto his brethren and he wept aloud and the egyptians heard and the house of pharaoh heard and joseph said unto his brethren i am joseph doth my father yet live and his brethren could not answer him for they were affrighted at his presence and joseph said unto his brethren come near to me i pray you and they came near and he said i am joseph your brother whom ye sold into egypt and now be not grieved nor angry with yourselves that ye sold me hither for god did send me before you to preserve life for these two years hath the famine been in the land and there are yet five years in which there shall be neither plowing nor harvest and god sent me before you to give you a remnant on the earth and to save you alive for a great deliverance so now it was not you that sent me hither but god and he hath made me a father to pharaoh and lord of all his house and ruler over all the land of egypt hasten ye and go up to my father and say unto him thus saith thy son joseph god hath made me lord of all egypt come down unto me tarry not and thou shalt dwell in the land of goshen and thou shalt be near unto me thou and thy children and thy childrens children and thy flocks and thy herds and all that thou hast and there will i sustain thee for there are yet five years of famine lest thou come to poverty thou and thy household and all that thou hast and behold your eyes see and the eyes of my brother benjamin that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you and ye shall tell my father of all my glory in egypt and of all that ye have seen and ye shall hasten and bring down my father hither and he fell upon his brother benjamins neck and wept and benjamin wept upon his neck and he kissed all his brethren and wept upon them and after that his brethren talked with him and the report thereof was heard in pharaohs house saying josephs brethren are come and it pleased pharaoh well and his servants and pharaoh said unto joseph say unto thy brethren this do ye lade your beasts and go get you unto the land of canaan and take your father and your households and come unto me and i will give you the good of the land of egypt and ye shall eat the fat of the land now thou art commanded this do ye take you wagons out of the land of egypt for your little ones and for your wives and bring your father and come also regard not your stuff for the good things of all the land of egypt are yours and the sons of israel did so and joseph gave them wagons according to the commandment of pharaoh and gave them provision for the way to all of them he gave each man changes of raiment but to benjamin he gave three hundred shekels of silver and five changes of raiment and to his father he sent in like manner ten asses laden with the good things of egypt and ten sheasses laden with corn and bread and victual for his father by the way so he sent his brethren away and they departed and he said unto them see that ye fall not out by the way and they went up out of egypt and came into the land of canaan unto jacob their father and they told him saying joseph is yet alive and he is ruler over all the land of egypt and his heart fainted for he believed them not and they told him all the words of joseph which he had said unto them and when he saw the wagons which joseph had sent to carry him the spirit of jacob their father revived and israel said it is enough joseph my son is yet alive i will go and see him before i die and israel took his journey with all that he had and came to beersheba and offered sacrifices unto the god of his father isaac and god spoke unto israel in the visions of the night and said jacob jacob and he said here am i and he said i am god the god of thy father fear not to go down into egypt for',\n",
       "  ' i will there make of thee a great nation i will go down with thee into egypt and i will also surely bring thee up again and joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes and jacob rose up from beersheba and the sons of israel carried jacob their father and their little ones and their wives in the wagons which pharaoh had sent to carry him and they took their cattle and their goods which they had gotten in the land of canaan and came into egypt jacob and all his seed with him his sons and his sons sons with him his daughters and his sons daughters and all his seed brought he with him into egypt s and these are the names of the children of israel who came into egypt jacob and his sons reuben jacobs firstborn and the sons of reuben hanoch and pallu and hezron and carmi and the sons of simeon jemuel and jamin and ohad and jachin and zohar and shaul the son of a canaanitish woman and the sons of levi gershon kohath and merari and the sons of judah er and onan and shelah and perez and zerah but er and onan died in the land of canaan and the sons of perez were hezron and hamul and the sons of issachar tola and puvah and iob and shimron and the sons of zebulun sered and elon and jahleel these are the sons of leah whom she bore unto jacob in paddanaram with his daughter dinah all the souls of his sons and his daughters were thirty and three and the sons of gad ziphion and haggi shuni and ezbon eri and arodi and areli and the sons of asher imnah and ishvah and ishvi and beriah and serah their sister and the sons of beriah heber and malchiel these are the sons of zilpah whom laban gave to leah his daughter and these she bore unto jacob even sixteen souls the sons of rachel jacobs wife joseph and benjamin and unto joseph in the land of egypt were born manasseh and ephraim whom asenath the daughter of potiphera priest of on bore unto him and the sons of benjamin bela and becher and ashbel gera and naaman ehi and rosh muppim and huppim and ard these are the sons

unto rachel his daughter and these she bore unto jacob all the souls were seven all the souls belonging to jacob that came into egypt that came out of his loins besides jacobs sons wives all the souls were threescore and six and the sons of joseph who were born to him in egypt were two souls all the souls of the house of jacob that came into egypt were threescore and ten s and he sent judah before him unto joseph to show the way before him unto goshen and they came into the land of goshen and joseph made ready his chariot and went up to meet israel his father to goshen and he presented himself unto him and fell on his neck and wept on his neck a good while and israel said unto joseph now let me die since i have seen thy face that thou art yet alive and joseph said unto his brethren and unto his fathers house i will go up and tell pharaoh and will say unto him my brethren and my fathers house who were in the land of canaan are come unto me and the men are shepherds for they have been keepers of cattle and they have brought their flocks and their herds and all that they have and it shall come to pass when pharaoh shall call you and shall say what is your occupation that ye shall say thy servants have been keepers of cattle from our youth even until now both we and our fathers that ye may dwell in the land of goshen for every shepherd is an abomination unto the egyptians then joseph went in and told pharaoh and said my father and my brethren and their flocks and their herds and all that they have are come out of the land of canaan and behold they are in the land of goshen and from among his brethren he took five men and presented them unto pharaoh and pharaoh said unto his brethren what is your occupation and they said unto pharaoh thy servants are shepherds both we and our fathers and they said unto pharaoh to sojourn in the land are we come for there is no pasture for thy servants flocks for the famine is sore in the land of canaan now therefore we pray thee let thy servants dwell in the land of goshen and pharaoh spoke unto joseph saying thy father and thy brethren are come unto thee the land of egypt is before thee in the best of the land make thy father and thy brethren to dwell in the land of goshen let them dwell and if thou knowest any able men among them then make them rulers over my cattle and joseph brought in jacob his father and set him before pharaoh and jacob blessed pharaoh and pharaoh said unto jacob how many are the days of the years of thy life and jacob said unto pharaoh the days of the years of my sojournings are a hundred and thirty years few and evil have been the days of the years of my life and they have not attained unto the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their sojournings and jacob blessed pharaoh and went out from the presence of pharaoh and joseph placed his father and his brethren and gave them a possession in the land of egypt in the best of the land in the land of rameses as pharaoh had commanded and joseph sustained his father and his brethren and all his fathers household with bread according to the want of their little ones and there was no bread in all the land for the famine was very sore so that the land of egypt and the land of canaan languished by reason of the famine and joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of egypt and in the land of canaan for the corn which they bought and joseph brought the money into pharaohs house and when the money was all spent in the land of egypt and in the land of canaan all the egyptians came unto joseph and said give us bread for why should we die in thy presence for our money faileth and joseph said give your cattle and i will give you  for your cattle if money fail and they brought their cattle unto joseph and joseph gave them bread in exchange for the horses and for the flocks and for the herds and for the asses and he fed them with bread in exchange for all their cattle for that year and when that year was ended they came unto him the second year and said unto him we will not hide from my lord how that our money is all spent and the herds of cattle are my lords there is nought left in the sight of my lord but our bodies and our lands wherefore should we die before thine eyes both we and our land buy us and our land for bread and we and our land will be bondmen unto pharaoh and give us seed that we may live and not die and that the land be not desolate so joseph bought all the land of egypt for pharaoh for the egyptians sold every man his field because the famine was sore upon them and the land became pharaohs and as for the people he removed them city by city from one end of the border of egypt even to the other end thereof only the land of the priests bought he not for the priests had a portion from pharaoh and did eat their portion which pharaoh gave them wherefore they sold not their land then joseph said unto the people behold i have bought you this day and your land for pharaoh lo here is seed for you and ye shall sow the land and it shall come to pass at the ingatherings that ye shall give a fifth unto pharaoh and four parts shall be your own for seed of the field and for your food and for them of your households and for food for your little ones and they said thou hast saved our lives let us find favour in the sight of my lord and we will be pharaohs bondmen and joseph made it a statute concerning the land of egypt unto this day that pharaoh should have the fifth only the land of the priests alone became not pharaohs and israel dwelt in the land of egypt in the land of goshen and they got them possessions therein and were fruitful and multiplied exceedingly and jacob lived in the land of egypt seventeen years so the days of jacob the years of his life were a hundred forty and seven years and the time drew near that israel must die and he called his son joseph and said unto him if now i have found favour in thy sight put i pray thee thy hand under my thigh and deal kindly and truly with me bury me not i pray thee in egypt but when i sleep with my fathers thou shalt carry me out of egypt and bury me in their buryingplace and he said i will do as thou hast said and he said swear unto me and he swore unto him and israel bowed down upon the beds head  and it came to pass after these things that one said to joseph behold thy father is sick and he took with him his two sons manasseh and ephraim and one told jacob and said behold thy son joseph cometh unto thee and israel strengthened himself and sat upon the bed and jacob said unto joseph god almighty appeared unto me at luz in the land of canaan and blessed me and said unto me behold i will make thee fruitful and multiply thee and i will make of thee a company of peoples and will give this land to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession and now thy two sons who were born unto thee in the land of egypt before i came unto thee into egypt are mine ephraim and manasseh even as reuben and simeon shall be mine and thy issue that thou begettest after them shall be thine they shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance and as for me when i came from paddan rachel died unto me in the land of canaan in the way when there was still some way to come unto ephrath and i buried her there in the way to ephraththe same is bet',\n",
       "  'hlehem and israel beheld josephs sons and said who are these and joseph said unto his father they are my sons whom god hath given me here and he said bring them i pray thee unto me and i will bless them now the eyes of israel were dim for age so that he could not see and he brought them near unto him and he kissed them and embraced them and israel said unto joseph i had not thought to see thy face and lo god hath let me see thy seed also and joseph brought them out from between his knees and he fell down on his face to the earth and joseph took them both ephraim in his right hand toward israels left hand and manasseh in his left hand toward israels right hand and brought them near unto him and israel stretched out his right hand and laid it upon ephraims head who was the younger and his left hand upon manassehs head guiding his hands wittingly for manasseh was the firstborn and he blessed joseph and said the god before whom my fathers abraham and isaac did walk the god who hath been my shepherd all my life long unto this day the angel who hath redeemed me from all evil bless the lads and let my name be named in them and the name of my fathers abraham and isaac and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth and when joseph saw that his father was laying his right hand upon the head of ephraim it displeased him and he held up his fathers hand to remove it from ephraims head unto manassehs head and joseph said unto his father not so my father for this is the firstborn put thy right hand upon his head and his father refused and said i know it my son i know it he also shall become a people and he also shall be great howbeit his younger brother shall be greater than he and his seed shall become a multitude of nations and he blessed them that day saying by thee shall israel bless saying god make thee as ephraim and as manasseh and he set ephraim before manasseh and israel said unto joseph behold i die but god will be with you and bring you back unto the land of your fathers moreover i have given to thee one portion above thy brethren which i took out of the hand of the amorite with my sword and with my bow  and jacob called unto his sons and said gather yourselves together that i may tell you that which shall befall you in the end of days assemble yourselves and hear ye sons of jacob and hearken unto israel your father reuben thou art my firstborn my might and the firstfruits of my strength the excellency of dignity and the excellency of power unstable as water have not thou the excellency because thou wentest up to thy fathers bed then defiledst thou ithe went up to my couch  simeon and levi are brethren weapons of violence their kinship let my soul not come into their council unto their assembly let my glory not be united for in their anger they slew men and in their selfwill they houghed oxen cursed be their anger for it was fierce and their wrath for it was cruel i will divide them in jacob and scatter them in israel  judah thee shall thy brethren praise thy hand shall be on the neck of thine enemies thy fathers sons shall bow down before thee judah is a lions whelp from the prey my son thou art gone up he stooped down he couched as a lion and as a lioness who shall rouse him up the sceptre shall not depart from judah nor the rulers staff from between his feet as long as men come to shiloh and unto him

a fruitful vine a fruitful vine by a fountain its branches run over the wall the archers have dealt bitterly with him and shot at him and hated him but his bow abode firm and the arms of his hands were made supple by the hands of the mighty one of jacob from thence from the shepherd the stone of israel even by the god of thy father who shall help thee and by the almighty who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above blessings of the deep that coucheth beneath blessings of the breasts and of the womb the blessings of thy father are mighty beyond the blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills they shall be on the head of joseph and on the crown of the head of the prince among his brethren  benjamin is a wolf that raveneth in the morning he devoureth the prey and at even he divideth the spoil all these are the twelve tribes of israel and this is it that their father spoke unto them and blessed them every one according to his blessing he blessed them and he charged them and said unto them i am to be gathered unto my people bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of ephron the hittite in the cave that is in the field of machpelah which is before mamre in the land of canaan which abraham bought with the field from ephron the hittite for a possession of a buryingplace there they buried abraham and sarah his wife there they buried isaac and rebekah his wife and there i buried leah the field and the cave that is therein which was purchased from the children of heth and when jacob made an end of charging his sons he gathered up his feet into the bed and expired and was gathered unto his people and joseph fell upon his fathers face and wept upon him and kissed him and joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father and the physicians embalmed israel and forty days were fulfilled for him for so are fulfilled the days of embalming and the egyptians wept for him threescore and ten days and when the days of weeping for him were past joseph spoke unto the house of pharaoh saying if now i have found favour in your eyes speak i pray you in the ears of pharaoh saying my father made me swear saying lo i die in my grave which i have digged for me in the land of canaan there shalt thou bury me now therefore let me go up i pray thee and bury my father and i will come back and pharaoh said go up and bury thy father according as he made thee swear and joseph went up to bury his father and with him went up all the servants of pharaoh the elders of his house and all the elders of the land of egypt and all the house of joseph and his brethren and his fathers house only their little ones and their flocks and their herds they left in the land of goshen and there went up with him both chariots and horsemen and it was a very great company and they came to the threshingfloor of atad which is beyond the jordan and there they wailed with a very great and sore wailing and he made a mourning for his father seven days and when the inhabitants of the land the canaanites saw the mourning in the floor of atad they said this is a grievous mourning to the egyptians wherefore the name of it was called abelmizraim which is beyond the jordan and his sons did unto him according as he commanded them for his sons carried him into the land of canaan and buried him in the cave of the field of machpelah which abraham bought with the field for a possession of a buryingplace of ephron the hittite in front of mamre and joseph returned into egypt he and his brethren and all that went up with him to bury his father after he had buried his father and when josephs brethren saw that their father was dead they said it may be that joseph will hate us and will fully requite us all the evil which we did unto him and they sent a message unto joseph saying thy father did command before he died saying so shall ye say unto joseph forgive i pray thee now the transgression of thy brethren and their sin for that they did unto thee evil and now we pray thee forgive the transgression of the servants of the god of thy father and joseph wept when they spoke unto him and his brethren also went and fell down before his face and they said behold we are thy bondmen and joseph said unto them fear not for am i in the place of god and as for you ye meant evil against me but god meant it for good to bring to pass as it is this day to save much people alive now therefore fear ye not i will sustain you and your little ones and he comforted them and spoke kindly unto them and joseph dwelt in egypt he and his fathers house and joseph lived a hundred and ten years and joseph saw ephraims children of the third generation the children also of machir the son of manasseh were born upon josephs knees and joseph said unto his brethren i die but god will surely remember you and bring you up out of this land unto the land which he swore to abraham to isaac and to jacob and joseph took an oath of the children of israel saying god will surely remember you and ye shall carry up my bones from hence so joseph died being a hundred and ten years old and they embalmed him and he was put in a coffin'],\n",

of god in the fifth day of the month which was the fifth year of king jehoiachins captivity the word of the lord came expressly unto ezekiel the priest the son of buzi in the land of the chaldeans by the river chebar and the hand of the lord was there upon him and i looked and behold a stormy wind came out of the north a great cloud with a fire flashing up so that a brightness was round about it and out of the midst thereof as the colour of electrum out of the midst of the fire and out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures and this was their appearance they had the likeness of a man and every one had four faces and every one of them had four wings and their feet were straight feet and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calfs foot and they sparkled like the colour of burnished brass and they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides and as for the faces and wings of them four their wings were joined one to another they turned not when they went they went every one straight forward as for the likeness of their faces they had the face of a man and they four had the face of a lion on the right side and they four had the face of an ox on the left side they four had also the face of an eagle thus were their faces and their wings were stretched upward two wings of every one were joined one to another and two covered their bodies and they went every one straight forward whither the spirit was to go they went they turned not when they went as for the likeness of the living creatures their appearance was like coals of fire burning like the appearance of torches it flashed up and down among the living creatures and there was brightness to the fire and out of the fire went forth lightning and the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning now as i beheld the living creatures behold one wheel at the bottom hard by the living creatures at the four faces thereof the appearance of the wheels and their work was like unto the colour of a beryl and they four had one likeness and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel within a wheel when they went they went toward their four sides they turned not when they went as for their rings they were high and they were dreadful and they four had their rings full of eyes round about and when the living creatures went the wheels went hard by them and when the living creatures were lifted up from the bottom the wheels were lifted up whithersoever the spirit was to go as the spirit was to go thither so they went and the wheels were lifted up beside them for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels when those went these went and when those stood these stood and when those were lifted up from the earth the wheels were lifted up beside them for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels and over the heads of the living creatures there was the likeness of a firmament like the colour of the terrible ice stretched forth over their heads above and under the firmament were their wings conformable the one to the other this one of them had two which covered and that one of them had two which covered their bodies and when they went i heard the noise of their wings like the noise of great waters like the voice of the almighty a noise of tumult like the noise of a host when they stood they let down their wings for when there was a voice above the firmament that was over their heads as they stood they let down their wings and above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne as the appearance of a sapphire stone and upon the likeness of the throne was a likeness as the appearance of a man upon it above and i saw as the colour of electrum as the appearance of fire round about enclosing it from the appearance of his loins and upward and from the appearance of his loins and downward i saw as it were the appearance of fire and there was brightness round about him as the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain so was the appearance of the brightness round about this was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the lord and when i saw it i fell upon my face and i heard a voice of one that spoke  and he said unto me son of man stand upon thy feet and i will speak with thee and spirit entered into me when he spoke unto me and set me upon my feet and i heard him that spoke unto me  and he said unto me son of man i send thee to the children of israel to rebellious nations that have rebelled against me they and their fathers have transgressed against me even unto this very day and the children are brazenfaced and stiffhearted i do send thee unto them and thou shalt say unto them thus saith the lord god and they whether they will hear or whether they will forbearfor they are a rebellious houseyet shall know that there hath been a prophet among them  and thou son of man be not afraid of them neither be afraid of their words though defiers and despisers be with thee and thou dost dwell among scorpions be not afraid of their words nor be dismayed at their looks for they are a rebellious house and thou shalt speak my words unto them whether they will hear or whether they will forbear for they are most rebellious  and thou son of man hear what i say unto thee be not thou rebellious like that rebellious house open thy mouth and eat that which i give thee and when i looked behold a hand was put forth unto me and lo a roll of a book was therein and he spread it before me and it was written within and without and there was written therein lamentations and moaning and woe s and he said unto me son of man eat that which thou findest eat this roll and go speak unto the house of israel so i opened my mouth and he caused me to eat that roll and he said unto me son of man cause thy belly to eat and fill thy bowels with this roll that i give thee then did i eat it and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness  and he said unto me son of man go get thee unto the house of israel and speak with my words unto them for thou art not sent to a people of an unintelligible speech and of a slow tongue but to the house of israel not to many peoples of an unintelligible speech and of a slow tongue whose words thou canst not understand surely if i sent thee to them they would hearken unto thee but the house of israel will not consent to hearken unto thee for they consent not to hearken unto me for all the house of israel are of a hard forehead and of a stiff heart behold i have made thy face hard against their faces and thy forehead hard against their foreheads as an adamant harder than flint have i made thy forehead fear them not neither be dismayed at their looks for they are a rebellious house  moreover he said unto me son of man all my words that i shall speak unto thee receive in thy heart and hear with thine ears and go get thee to them of the captivity unto the children of thy people and speak unto them and tell them thus saith the lord god whether they will hear or whether they will forbear then a spirit lifted me up and i heard behind me the voice of a great rushing blessed be the glory of the lord from his place also the noise of the wings of the living creatures as they touched one another and the noise of the wheels beside them even the noise of a great rushing so a spirit lifted me up and took me away and i went in bitterness in the heat of my spirit and the hand of the lord was strong upon me then i came to them of the captivity at telabib that dwelt by the river chebar and i sat where they sat and i remained there appalled among them seven days and it came to pass at the end of seven days p\\xa0that the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man i have appointed thee a watchman unto the house of israel and when thou shalt hear a word at my mouth thou shalt give them warning from me when i say unto the wicked thou shalt surely die and thou givest him not warning nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way to save his life the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity but his blood will i require at thy hand yet if thou warn the wicked and he turn not from his wickedness nor from his wicked way he shall die in his iniquity but thou hast delivered thy soul again when a righteous man doth turn from his righteousness and commit iniquity i will lay a stumblingblock before him he shall die because thou hast not given him warning he shall die in his sin and his righteous deeds which he hath done shall not be remembered but his blood will i require at thy hand nevertheless if thou warn the righteous man that the righteous sin not and he doth not sin he shall surely live because he took warning and thou hast delivered thy soul  and the hand of the lord came there upon me and he said unto me arise go forth into the plain and i will there speak with thee then i arose and went forth into the plain and behold the glory of the lord stood there as the glory which i saw by the river chebar and i fell on my face then spirit entered into me and set me upon my feet and he spoke with me and said unto me go shut thyself within thy house but thou son of man behold bands shall be put upon thee and thou shalt be bound with them and thou shalt not go out among them and i will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth that thou shalt be dumb and shalt not be to them a reprover for they are a rebellious house but when i speak with thee i will open thy mouth and thou shalt say unto them thus saith the lord god he that heareth let him hear and he that forbeareth let him forbear for they are a rebellious house  thou also son of man take thee a tile and lay it before thee and trace upon it a city even jerusalem and lay siege against it and build forts against it and cast up a mound against',\n",
       "  ' it set camps also against it and set battering rams against it round about and take thou unto thee an iron griddle and set it for a wall of iron between thee and the city and set thy face toward it and it shall be besieged and thou shalt lay siege against it this shall be a sign to the house of israel  moreover lie thou upon thy left side and lay the iniquity of the house of israel upon it according to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon it thou shalt bear their iniquity for i have appointed the years of their iniquity to be unto thee a number of days even three hundred and ninety days so shalt thou bear the iniquity of the house of israel and again when thou hast accomplished these thou shalt lie on thy right side and shalt bear the iniquity of the house of judah forty days each day for a year have i appointed it unto thee and thou shalt set thy face toward the siege of jerusalem with thine arm uncovered and thou shalt prophesy against it and behold i lay bands upon thee and thou shalt not turn thee from one side to another till thou hast accomplished the days of thy siege take thou also unto thee wheat and barley and beans and lentils and millet and spelt and put them in one vessel and make thee bread thereof according to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon thy side even three hundred and ninety days shalt thou eat thereof and thy food which thou shalt eat shall be by weight twenty shekels a day from time to time shalt thou eat it thou shalt drink also water by measure the sixth part of a hin from time to time shalt thou drink and thou shalt eat it as barley cakes and thou shalt bake it in their sight with dung that cometh out of man s and the lord said even thus shall the children of israel eat their bread unclean among the nations whither i will drive them then said i ah lord god behold my soul hath not been polluted for from my youth up even till now have i not eaten of that which dieth of itself or is torn of beasts neither came there abhorred flesh into my mouth s then he said unto me see i have given thee cows dung for mans dung and thou shalt prepare thy bread thereon s moreover he said unto me son of man behold i will break the staff of bread in jerusalem and they shall eat bread by weight and with anxiety and they shall drink water by measure and in appalment that they may want bread and water and be appalled one with another and pine away in their iniquity  and thou son of man take thee a sharp sword as a barbers razor shalt thou take it unto thee and cause it to pass upon thy head and upon thy beard then take thee balances to weigh and divide the hair a third part shalt thou burn in the fire in the midst of the city when the days of the siege are fulfilled and thou shalt take a third part and smite it with the sword round about her and a third part thou shalt scatter to the wind and i will draw out a sword after them thou shalt also take thereof a few by number and bind them in thy skirts and of them again shalt thou take and cast them into the midst of the fire and burn them in the fire therefrom shall a fire come forth into all the house of israel  thus saith the lord god this is jerusalem i have set her in the midst of the nations and countries are round about her and she hath rebelled against mine ordinances in doing wickedness more than the nations and against my statutes more than the countries that are round about her for they have rejected mine ordinances and as for my statutes they have not walked in them s therefore thus saith the lord god because ye have outdone the nations that are round about you in that ye have not walked in my statutes neither have kept mine ordinances neither have done after the ordinances of the nations that are round about you therefore thus saith the lord god behold i even i am against thee and i will execute judgments in the midst of thee in the sight of the nations and i will do in thee that which i have not done and whereunto i will not do any more the like because of all thine abominations  therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of thee and the sons shall eat their fathers and i will execute judgments in thee and the whole remnant of thee will i scatter unto all the winds s wherefore as i live saith the lord god surely because thou hast defiled my sanctuary with all thy detestable things and with all thine abominations therefore will i also diminish thee neither shall mine eye spare and i also will have no pity a third part of thee shall die with the pestilence and with famine shall they be consumed in the midst of thee and a third part shall fall by the sword round about thee and a third part i will scatter unto all the winds and will draw out a sword after them thus shall mine anger spend itself and i will satisfy my fury upon them and i will be eased and they shall know that i the lord have spoken in my zeal when i have spent my fury upon them moreover i will make thee an amazement and a reproach among the nations that are round about thee in the sight of all that pass by so it shall be a reproach and a taunt an instruction and an astonishment unto the nations that are round about thee when i shall execute judgments in thee in anger and in fury and in furious rebukes i the lord have spoken it when i shall send upon them the evil arrows of famine that are for destruction which i will send to destroy you and i will increase the famine upon you and will break your staff of bread and i will send upon you famine and evil beasts and they shall bereave thee and pestilence and blood shall pass through thee and i will bring the sword upon thee i the lord have spoken it  and the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man set thy face toward the mountains of israel and prophesy against them and say ye mountains of israel hear the word of the lord god thus saith the lord god concerning the mountains and concerning the hills concerning the ravines and concerning the valleys behold i even i will bring a sword upon you and i will destroy your high places and your altars shall become desolate and your sunimages shall be broken and i will cast down your slain men before your idols and i will lay the carcasses of the children of israel before their idols and i will scatter your bones round about your altars in all your dwellingplaces the cities shall be laid waste and the high places shall be desolate that your altars may be laid waste and made desolate and your idols may be broken and cease and your sunimages may be hewn down and your works may be blotted out and the slain shall fall in the midst of you and ye shall know that i am the lord yet will i leave a remnant in that ye shall have some that escape the sword among the nations when ye shall be scattered through the countries and they that escape of you shall remember me among the nations whither they shall be carried captives how that i have been anguished with their straying heart which hath departed from me and with their eyes which are gone astray after their idols and they shall loathe themselves in their own sight for the evils which they have committed in all their abominations and they shall know that i am the lord i have not said in vain that i would do this evil unto them  thus saith the lord god smite with thy hand and stamp with thy foot and say alas because of all the evil abominations of the house of israel for they shall fall by the sword by the famine and by the pestilence he that is far off shall die of the pestilence and he that is near shall fall by the sword and he that remaineth and is besieged shall die by the famine thus will i spend my fury upon them and ye shall know that i am the lord when their slain men shall be among their idols round about their altars upon every high hill in all the tops of the mountains and under every leafy tree and under every thick terebinth the place where they did offer sweet savour to all their idols and i will stretch out my hand upon them and make the land desolate and waste more than the wilderness of diblah throughout all their habitations and they shall know that i am the lord  moreover the word of the lord came unto me saying and thou son of man thus saith the lord god concerning the land of israel an end the end is come upon the four corners of the land now is the end upon thee and i will send mine anger upon thee and will judge thee according to thy ways and i will bring upon thee all thine abominations and mine eye shall not spare thee neither will i have pity but i will bring thy ways upon thee and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee and ye shall know that i am the lord  thus saith the lord god an evil a singular evil behold it cometh an end is come the end is come it awaketh against thee behold it cometh the turn is come unto thee o inhabitant of the land the time is come the day of tumult is near and not of joyful shouting upon the mountains now will i shortly pour out my fury upon thee and spend mine anger upon thee and will judge thee according to thy ways and i will bring upon thee all thine abominations and mine eye shall not spare neither will i have pity i will bring upon thee according to thy ways and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee and ye shall know that i the lord do smite behold the day behold it cometh the turn is come forth the rod hath blossomed arrogancy hath budded violence is risen up into a rod of wickedness nought cometh from them nor from their tumult nor from their turmoil neither is there eminency among them the time is come the day draweth near let not the buyer rejoice nor the seller mourn for wrath is upon all the multitude thereof for the seller shall not return to that which is sold although they be yet alive for the vision is touching the whole multitude thereof which shall not return neither shall any stand possessed of the iniquity of his life they have blown the horn and have made all ready but none goeth to the battle for my wrath is upon all the',\n",
       "  ' multitude thereof the sword is without and the pestilence and the famine within he that is in the field shall die with the sword and he that is in the city famine and pestilence shall devour him but they that shall at all escape of them shall be on the mountains like doves of the valleys all of them moaning every one in his iniquity all hands shall be slack and all knees shall drip with water they shall also gird themselves with sackcloth and horror shall cover them and shame shall be upon all faces and baldness upon all their heads they shall cast their silver in the streets and their gold shall be as an unclean thing their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the lord they shall not satisfy their souls neither fill their bowels because it hath been the stumblingblock of their iniquity and as for the beauty of their ornament which was set for a pride they made the images of their abominations and their detestable things thereof therefore have i made it unto them as an unclean thing and i will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil and they shall profane it i will also turn my face from them and they shall profane my secret place and robbers shall enter into it and profane it  make the chain for the land is full of bloody crimes and the city is full of violence wherefore i will bring the worst of the nations and they shall possess their houses i will also make the pride of the strong to cease and their holy places shall be profaned horror cometh and they shall seek peace and there shall be none calamity shall come upon calamity and rumour shall be upon rumour and they shall seek a vision of the prophet and instruction shall perish from the priest and counsel from the elders the king shall mourn and the prince shall be clothed with appalment and the hands of the people of the land shall be enfeebled i will do unto them after their way and according to their deserts will i judge them and they shall know that i am the lord  and it came to pass in the sixth year in the sixth month in the fifth day of the month as i sat in my house and the elders of judah sat before me that the hand of the lord god fell there upon me then i beheld and lo a likeness as the appearance of fire from the appearance of his loins and downward fire and from his loins and upward as the appearance of brightness as the colour of electrum and the form of a hand was put forth and i was taken by a lock of my head and a spirit lifted me up between the earth and the heaven and brought me in the visions of god to jerusalem to the door of the gate of the inner court that looketh toward the north where was the seat of the image of jealousy which provoketh to jealousy and behold the glory of the god of israel was there according to the vision that i saw in the plain then said he unto me son of man lift up thine eyes now the way toward the north so i lifted up mine eyes the way toward the north and behold northward of the gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the entry and he said unto me son of man seest thou what they do even the great abominations that the house of israel do commit here that i should go far off from my sanctuary but thou shalt again see yet greater abominations  and he brought me to the door of the court and when i looked behold a hole in the wall then said he unto me son of man dig now in the wall and when i had digged in the wall behold a door s and he said unto me go in and see the wicked abominations that they do here so i went in and saw and behold every detestable form of creeping things and beasts and all the idols of the house of israel portrayed upon the wall round about and there stood before them seventy men of the elders of the house of israel and in the midst of them stood jaazaniah the son of shaphan every man with his censer in his hand and a thick cloud of incense went up then said he unto me son of man hast thou seen what the elders of the house of israel do in the dark every man in his chambers of imagery for they say the lord seeth us not the lord hath forsaken the land he said also unto me thou shalt again see yet greater abominations which they do then he brought me to the door of the gate of the lords house which was toward the north and behold there sat the women weeping for tammuz s then said he unto me hast thou seen this o son of man thou shalt again see yet greater abominations than these and he brought me into the inner court of the lords house and behold at the door of the temple of the lord between the porch and the altar were about five and twenty men with their backs toward the temple of the lord and their faces toward the east and they worshipped the sun toward the east then he said unto me hast thou seen this o son of man is it a light thing to the house of judah that they commit the abominations which they commit here in that they fill the land with violence and provoke me still more and lo they put the branch to their nose therefore will i also deal in fury mine eye shall not spare neither will i have pity and though they cry in mine ears with a loud voice yet will i not hear them then he called in mine ears with a loud voice saying cause ye them that have charge over the city to draw near every man with his destroying weapon in his hand and behold six men came from the way of the upper gate which lieth toward the north every man with his weapon of destruction in his hand and one man in the midst of them clothed in linen with a writers inkhorn on his side and they went in and stood beside the brazen altar and the glory of the god of israel was gone up from the cherub whereupon it was to the threshold of the house and he called to the man clothed in linen who had the writers inkhorn on his side  and the lord said unto him go through the midst of the city through the midst of jerusalem and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all the abominations that are done in the midst thereof and to the others he said in my hearing go ye through the city after him and smite let not your eye spare neither have ye pity slay utterly the old man the young man and the maiden and little children and women but come not near any man upon whom is the mark and begin at my sanctuary then they began at the elders that were before the house and he said unto them defile the house and fill the courts with the slain go ye forth and they went forth and smote in the city and it came to pass while they were smiting and i was left that i fell upon my face and cried and said ah lord god wilt thou destroy all the residue of israel in thy pouring out of thy fury upon jerusalem then said he unto me the iniquity of the house of israel and judah is exceeding great and the land is full of blood and the city full of wresting of judgment for they say the lord hath forsaken the land and the lord seeth not and as for me also mine eye shall not spare neither will i have pity but i will bring their way upon their head and behold the man clothed in linen who had the inkhorn on his side reported saying i have done according to all that thou hast commanded me  then i looked and behold upon the firmament that was over the head of the cherubim there appeared above them as it were a sapphire stone as the appearance of the likeness of a throne and he spoke unto the man clothed in linen and said go in between the wheelwork even under the cherub and fill both thy hands with coals of fire from between the cherubim and dash them against the city and he went in in my sight now the cherubim stood on the right side of the house when the man went in and the cloud filled the inner court and the glory of the lord mounted up from the cherub to the threshold of the house and the house was filled with the cloud and the court was full of the brightness of the lords glory and the sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard even to the outer court as the voice of god almighty when he speaketh and it came to pass when he commanded the man clothed in linen saying take fire from between the wheelwork from between the cherubim that he went in and stood beside a wheel and the cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubim unto the fire that was between the cherubim and took thereof and put it into the hands of him that was clothed in linen who took it and went out and there appeared in the cherubim the form of a mans hand under their wings and i looked and behold four wheels beside the cherubim one wheel beside one cherub and another wheel beside another cherub and the appearance of the wheels was as the colour of a beryl stone and as for their appearance they four had one likeness as if a wheel had been within a wheel when they went they went toward their four sides they turned not as they went but to the place whither the head looked they followed it they turned not as they went and their whole body and their backs and their hands and their wings and the wheels were full of eyes round about even the wheels that they four had as for the wheels they were called in my hearing the wheelwork and every one had four faces the first face was the face of the cherub and the second face was the face of a man and the third the face of a lion and the fourth the face of an eagle and the cherubim mounted upthis is the living creature that i saw by the river chebar and when the cherubim went the wheels went beside them and when the cherubim lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth the same wheels also turned not from beside them when they stood these stood and when they mounted up these mounted up with them for the spirit of the living creature was in them and the glory of the lord went forth from off the threshold of the house and stood over the cherubim and the cherubim lifted up their wings and mounted up from the earth in my sight when they went forth and the wheels beside them and they stood at the door of the east gate o',\n",
       "  'f the lords house and the glory of the god of israel was over them above this is the living creature that i saw under the god of israel by the river chebar and i knew that they were cherubim every one had four faces apiece and every one four wings and the likeness of the hands of a man was under their wings and as for the likeness of their faces they were the faces which i saw by the river chebar their appearances and themselves they went every one straight forward then a spirit lifted me up and brought me unto the east gate of the lords house which looketh eastward and behold at the door of the gate five and twenty men and i saw in the midst of them jaazaniah the son of azzur and pelatiah the son of benaiah princes of the people  and he said unto me son of man these are the men that devise iniquity and that give wicked counsel in this city that say the time is not near to build houses this city is the caldron and we are the flesh s therefore prophesy against them prophesy o son of man and the spirit of the lord fell upon me and he said unto me speak thus saith the lord thus have ye said o house of israel for i know the things that come into your mind ye have multiplied your slain in this city and ye have filled the streets thereof with the slain  therefore thus saith the lord god your slain whom ye have laid in the midst of it they are the flesh and this city is the caldron but ye shall be brought forth out of the midst of it ye have feared the sword and the sword will i bring upon you saith the lord god and i will bring you forth out of the midst thereof and deliver you into the hands of strangers and will execute judgments among you ye shall fall by the sword i will judge you upon the border of israel and ye shall know that i am the lord though this city shall not be your caldron ye shall be the flesh in the midst thereof i will judge you upon the border of israel and ye shall know that i am the lord for ye have not walked in my statutes neither have ye executed mine ordinances but have done after the ordinances of the nations that are round about you and it came to pass when i prophesied that pelatiah the son of benaiah died then fell i down upon my face and cried with a loud voice and said ah lord god wilt thou make a full end of the remnant of israel  and the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man as for thy brethren even thy brethren the men of thy kindred and all the house of israel all of them concerning whom the inhabitants of jerusalem have said get you far from the lord unto us is this land given for a possession s therefore say thus saith the lord god although i have removed them far off among the nations and although i have scattered them among the countries yet have i been to them as a little sanctuary in the countries where they are come s therefore say thus saith the lord god i will even gather you from the peoples and assemble you out of the countries where ye have been scattered and i will give you the land of israel and they shall come thither and they shall take away all the detestable things thereof and all the abominations thereof from thence and i will give them one heart and i will put a new spirit within you and i will remove the stony heart out of their flesh and will give them a heart of flesh that they may walk in my statutes and keep mine ordinances and do them and they shall be my people and i will be their god but as for them whose heart walketh after the heart of their detestable things and their abominations i will bring their way upon their own heads saith the lord god then did the cherubim lift up their wings and the wheels were beside them and the glory of the god of israel was over them above and the glory of the lord went up from the midst of the city and stood upon the mountain which is on the east side of the city and a spirit lifted me up and brought me in the vision by the spirit of god into chaldea to them of the captivity so the vision that i had seen went up from me then i spoke unto them of the captivity all the things that the lord had shown me  the word of the lord also came unto me saying son of man thou dwellest in the midst of the rebellious house that have eyes to see and see not that have ears to hear and hear not for they are a rebellious house therefore thou son of man prepare thee stuff for exile and remove as though for exile by day in their sight and thou shalt remove from thy place to another place in their sight it may be they will perceive for they are a rebellious house and thou shalt bring forth thy stuff by day in their sight as stuff for exile and thou shalt go forth thyself at even in their sight as when men go forth into exile dig thou through the wall in their sight and carry out thereby in their sight shalt thou bear it upon thy shoulder and carry it forth in the darkness thou shalt cover thy face that thou see not the ground for i have set thee for a sign unto the house of israel and i did so as i was commanded i brought forth my stuff by day as stuff for exile and in the even i digged through the wall with my hand i carried out in the darkness and bore it upon my shoulder in their sight  and in the morning came the word of the lord unto me saying son of man hath not the house of israel the rebellious house said unto thee what doest thou say thou unto them thus saith the lord god concerning the prince even this burden in jerusalem and all the house of israel among whom they are say i am your sign like as i have done so shall it be done unto themthey shall go into exile into captivity and the prince that is among them shall bear upon his shoulder and go forth in the darkness they shall dig through the wall to carry out thereby he shall cover his face that he see not the ground with his eyes my net also will i spread upon him and he shall be taken in my snare and i will bring him to babylon to the land of the chaldeans yet shall he not see it though he shall die there and i will disperse toward every wind all that are round about him to help him and all his troops and i will draw out the sword after them and they shall know that i am the lord when i shall scatter them among the nations and disperse them in the countries but i will leave a few men of them from the sword from the famine and from the pestilence that they may declare all their abominations among the nations whither they come and they shall know that i am the lord  moreover the word of the lord came to me saying son of man eat thy bread with quaking and drink thy water with trembling and with anxiety and say unto the people of the land thus saith the lord god concerning the inhabitants of jerusalem in the land of israel they shall eat their bread with anxiety and drink their water with appalment that her land may be desolate from all that is therein because of the violence of all them that dwell therein and the cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste and the land shall be desolate and ye shall know that i am the lord  and the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man what is that proverb that ye have in the land of israel saying the days are prolonged and every vision faileth tell them therefore thus saith the lord god i will make this proverb to cease and they shall no more use it as a proverb in israel but say unto them the days are at hand and the word of every vision for there shall be no more any vain vision nor smooth divination within the house of israel for i am the lord i will speak what word soever it be that i shall speak and it shall be performed it shall be no more delayed for in your days o rebellious house will i speak the word and will perform it saith the lord god  again the word of the lord came to me saying son of man behold they of the house of israel say the vision that he seeth is for many days to come and he prophesieth of times that are far off therefore say unto them thus saith the lord god there shall none of my words be delayed any more but the word which i shall speak shall be performed saith the lord god  and the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man prophesy against the prophets of israel that prophesy and say thou unto them that prophesy out of their own heart hear ye the word of the lord thus saith the lord god woe unto the vile prophets that follow their own spirit and things which they have not seen o israel thy prophets have been like foxes in ruins ye have not gone up into the breaches neither made up the hedge for the house of israel to stand in the battle in the day of the lord they have seen vanity and lying divination that say the lord saith and the lord hath not sent them yet they hope that the word would be confirmed have ye not seen a vain vision and have ye not spoken a lying divination whereas ye say the lord saith albeit i have not spoken s therefore thus saith the lord god because ye have spoken vanity and seen lies therefore behold i am against you saith the lord god and my hand shall be against the prophets that see vanity and that divine lies they shall not be in the council of my people neither shall they be written in the register of the house of israel neither shall they enter into the land of israel and ye shall know that i am the lord god because even because they have led my people astray saying peace and there is no peace and when it buildeth up a slight wall behold they daub it with whited plaster say unto them that daub it with whited plaster that it shall fall there shall be an overflowing shower and ye o great hailstones shall fall and a stormy wind shall break forth and lo when the wall is fallen shall it not be said unto you where is the daubing wherewith ye have daubed it s therefore thus saith the lord god i will even cause a stormy wind to break forth in my fury and there shall be an overflowing shower in mine anger and great hailstones in fury to consume it so will i break down the wall that ye have daubed with whited plaster and bring it down to the ground so that the foundation th',\n",
       "  'ereof shall be uncovered and it shall fall and ye shall be consumed in the midst thereof and ye shall know that i am the lord thus will i spend my fury upon the wall and upon them that have daubed it with whited plaster and i will say unto you the wall is no more neither they that daubed it to wit the prophets of israel that prophesy concerning jerusalem and that see visions of peace for her and there is no peace saith the lord god  and thou son of man set thy face against the daughters of thy people that prophesy out of their own heart and prophesy thou against them and say thus saith the lord god woe to the women that sew cushions upon all elbows and make pads for the head of persons of every stature to hunt souls will ye hunt the souls of my people and save souls alive for yourselves and ye have profaned me among my people for handfuls of barley and for crumbs of bread to slay the souls that should not die and to save the souls alive that should not live by your lying to my people that hearken unto lies s wherefore thus saith the lord god behold i am against your cushions wherewith ye hunt the souls as birds and i will tear them from your arms and i will let the souls go even the souls that ye hunt as birds your pads also will i tear and deliver my people out of your hand and they shall be no more in your hand to be hunted and ye shall know that i am the lord because with lies ye have cowed the heart of the righteous when i have not grieved him and strengthened the hands of the wicked that he should not return from his wicked way that he be saved alive therefore ye shall no more see vanity nor divine divinations and i will deliver my people out of your hand and ye shall know that i am the lord then came certain of the elders of israel unto me and sat before me  and the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man these men have set up their idols in their mind and put the stumblingblock of their iniquity before their face should i be inquired of at all by them s therefore speak unto them and say unto them thus saith the lord god every man of the house of israel that setteth up his idols in his mind and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face and cometh to the propheti the lord will answer him that cometh according to the multitude of his idols that i may take the house of israel in their own heart because they are all turned away from me through their idols s therefore say unto the house of israel thus saith the lord god return ye and turn yourselves from your idols and turn away your faces from all your abominations for every one of the house of israel or of the strangers that sojourn in israel that separateth himself from me and taketh his idols into his heart and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face and cometh to the prophet that he inquire for him of mei the lord will answer him by myself and i will set my face against that man and will make him a sign and a proverb and i will cut him off from the midst of my people and ye shall know that i am the lord s and when the prophet is enticed and speaketh a word i the lord have enticed that prophet and i will stretch out my hand upon him and will destroy him from the midst of my people israel and they shall bear their iniquity the iniquity of the prophet shall be even as the iniquity of him that inquireth that the house of israel may go no more astray from me neither defile themselves any more with all their transgressions but that they may be my people and i may be their god saith the lord god  and the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man when a land sinneth against me by trespassing grievously and i stretch out my hand upon it and break the staff of the bread thereof and send famine upon it and cut off from it man and beast though these three men noah daniel and job were in it they should deliver but their own souls by their righteousness saith the lord god if i cause evil beasts to pass through the land and they bereave it and it be desolate so that no man may pass through because of the beasts though these three men were in it as i live saith the lord god they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters they only shall be delivered but the land shall be desolate or if i bring a sword upon that land and say let the sword go through the land so that i cut off from it man and beast though these three men were in it as i live saith the lord god they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters but they only shall be delivered themselves or if i send a pestilence into that land and pour out my fury upon it in blood to cut off from it man and beast though noah daniel and job were in it as i live saith the lord god they shall deliver neither son nor daughter they shall but deliver their own souls by their righteousness  for thus saith the lord god how much more when i send my four sore judgments against jerusalem the sword and the famine and the evil beasts and the pestilence to cut off from it man and beast and behold though there be left a remnant therein that shall be brought forth both sons and daughters behold when they come forth unto you and ye see their way and their doings then ye shall be comforted concerning the evil that i have brought upon jerusalem even concerning all that i have brought upon it and they shall comfort you when ye see their way and their doings and ye shall know that i have not done without cause all that i have done in it saith the lord god  and the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man what is the vinetree more than any tree the vine branch which grew up among the trees of the forest shall wood be taken thereof to make any work or will men take a pin of it to hang any vessel thereon behold it is cast into the fire for fuel the fire hath devoured both the ends of it and the midst of it is singed is it profitable for any work behold when it was whole it was meet for no work how much less when the fire hath devoured it and it is singed shall it yet be meet for any work s therefore thus saith the lord god as the vinetree among the trees of the forest which i have given to the fire for fuel so do i give the inhabitants of jerusalem and i will set my face against them out of the fire are they come forth and the fire shall devour them and ye shall know that i am the lord when i set my face against them and i will make the land desolate because they have acted treacherously saith the lord god  again the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man cause jerusalem to know her abominations and say thus saith the lord god unto jerusalem thine origin and thy nativity is of the land of the canaanite the amorite was thy father and thy mother was a hittite and as for thy nativity in the day thou wast born thy navel was not cut neither wast thou washed in water for cleansing thou was not salted at all nor swaddled at all no eye pitied thee to do any of these unto thee to have compassion upon thee but thou wast cast out in the open field in the loathsomeness of thy person in the day that thou wast born and when i passed by thee and saw thee wallowing in thy blood i said unto thee in thy blood live yea i said unto thee in thy blood live i cause thee to increase even as the growth of the field and thou didst increase and grow up and thou camest to excellent beauty thy breasts were fashioned and thy hair was grown yet thou wast naked and bare now when i passed by thee and looked upon thee and behold thy time was the time of love i spread my skirt over thee and covered thy nakedness yea i swore unto thee and entered into a covenant with thee saith the lord god and thou becamest mine then washed i thee with water yea i cleansed away thy blood from thee and i anointed thee with oil i clothed thee also with richly woven work and shod thee with sealskin and i wound fine linen about thy head and covered thee with silk i decked thee also with ornaments and i put bracelets upon thy hands and a chain on thy neck and i put a ring upon thy nose and earrings in thine ears and a beautiful crown upon thy head thus wast thou decked with gold and silver and thy raiment was of fine linen and silk and richly woven work thou didst eat fine flour and honey and oil and thou didst wax exceeding beautiful and thou wast meet for royal estate and thy renown went forth among the nations for thy beauty for it was perfect through my splendour which i had put upon thee saith the lord god but thou didst trust in thy beauty and play the harlot because of thy renown and didst pour out thy harlotries on every one that passed by his it was and thou didst take of thy garments and didst make for thee high places decked with divers colours and didst play the harlot upon them the like things shall not come neither shall it be so thou didst also take thy fair jewels of my gold and of my silver which i had given thee and madest for thee images of men and didst play the harlot with them and thou didst take thy richly woven garments and cover them and didst set mine oil and mine incense before them my bread also which i gave thee fine flour and oil and honey wherewith i fed thee thou didst even set it before them for a sweet savour and thus it was saith the lord god moreover thou hast taken thy sons and thy daughters whom thou hast borne unto me and these hast thou sacrificed unto them to be devoured were thy harlotries a small matter that thou hast slain my children and delivered them up in setting them apart unto them and in all thine abominations and thy harlotries thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth when thou wast naked and bare and wast wallowing in thy blood and it came to pass after all thy wickednesswoe woe unto thee saith the lord god that thou hast built unto thee an eminent place and hast made thee a lofty place in every street thou hast built thy lofty place at every head of the way and hast made thy beauty an abomination and hast opened thy feet to every one that passed by and multiplied thy harlotries thou',\n",
       "  ' hast also played the harlot with the egyptians thy neighbours great of flesh and hast multiplied thy harlotry to provoke me behold therefore i have stretched out my hand over thee and have diminished thine allowance and delivered thee unto the will of them that hate thee the daughters of the philistines that are ashamed of thy lewd way thou hast played the harlot also with the assyrians without having enough yea thou hast played the harlot with them and yet thou wast not satisfied thou hast moreover multiplied thy harlotry with the land of traffic even with chaldea and yet thou didst not have enough herewith how weak is thy heart saith the lord god seeing thou doest all these things the work of a wanton harlot in that thou buildest thine eminent place in the head of every way and makest thy lofty place in every street and hast not been as a harlot that enhanceth her hire thou wife that committest adultery that takest strangers instead of thy husband to all harlots gifts are given but thou hast given thy gifts to all thy lovers and hast bribed them to come unto thee from every side in thy harlotries and the contrary is in thee from other women in that thou didst solicit to harlotry and wast not solicited and in that thou givest hire and no hire is given unto thee thus thou art contrary wherefore o harlot hear the word of the lord  thus saith the lord god because thy filthiness was poured out and thy nakedness uncovered through thy harlotries with thy lovers and because of all the idols of thy abominations and for the blood of thy children that thou didst give unto them therefore behold i will gather all thy lovers unto whom thou hast been pleasant and all them that thou hast loved with all them that thou hast hated i will even gather them against thee from every side and will uncover thy nakedness unto them that they may see all thy nakedness and i will judge thee as women that break wedlock and shed blood are judged and i will bring upon thee the blood of fury and jealousy i will also give thee into their hand and they shall throw down thine eminent place and break down thy lofty places and they shall strip thee of thy clothes and take thy fair jewels and they shall leave thee naked and bare they shall also bring up an assembly against thee and they shall stone thee with stones and thrust thee through with their swords and they shall burn thy houses with fire and execute judgments upon thee in the sight of many women and i will cause thee to cease from playing the harlot and thou shalt also give no hire any more so will i satisfy my fury upon thee and my jealousy shall depart from thee and i will be quiet and will be no more angry because thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth but hast fretted me in all these things lo therefore i also will bring thy way upon thy head saith the lord god or hast thou not committed this lewdness above all thine abominations behold every one that useth proverbs shall use this proverb against thee saying as the mother so her daughter thou art thy mothers daughter that loatheth her husband and her children and thou art the sister of thy sisters who loathed their husbands and their children your mother was a hittite and your father an amorite and thine elder sister is samaria that dwelleth at thy left hand she and her daughters and thy younger sister that dwelleth at thy right hand is sodom and her daughters yet hast thou not walked in their ways nor done after their abominations but in a very little while thou didst deal more corruptly than they in all thy ways as i live saith the lord god sodom thy sister hath not done she nor her daughters as thou hast done thou and thy daughters behold this was the iniquity of thy sister sodom pride fulness of bread and careless ease was in her and in her daughters neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy and they were haughty and committed abomination before me therefore i removed them when i saw it s neither hath samaria committed even half of thy sins but thou hast multiplied thine abominations more than they and hast justified thy sisters by all thine abominations which thou hast done thou also bear thine own shame in that thou hast given judgment for thy sisters through thy sins that thou hast committed more abominable than they they are more righteous than thou yea be thou also confounded and bear thy shame in that thou hast justified thy sisters and i will turn their captivity the captivity of sodom and her daughters and the captivity of samaria and her daughters and the captivity of thy captives in the midst of them that thou mayest bear thine own shame and mayest be ashamed because of all that thou hast done in that thou art a comfort unto them and thy sisters sodom and her daughters shall return to their former estate and samaria and her daughters shall return to their former estate and thou and thy daughters shall return to your former estate for thy sister sodom was not mentioned by thy mouth in the day of thy pride before thy wickedness was uncovered as at the time of the taunt of the daughters of aram and of all that are round about her the daughters of the philistines that have thee in disdain round about thou hast borne thy lewdness and thine abominations saith the lord s for thus saith the lord god i will even deal with thee as thou hast done who hast despised the oath in breaking the covenant nevertheless i will remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth and i will establish unto thee an everlasting covenant then shalt thou remember thy ways and be ashamed when thou shalt receive thy sisters thine elder sisters and thy younger and i will give them unto thee for daughters but not because of thy covenant and i will establish my covenant with thee and thou shalt know that i am the lord that thou mayest remember and be confounded and never open thy mouth any more because of thy shame when i have forgiven thee all that thou hast done saith the lord god  and the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man put forth a riddle and speak a parable unto the house of israel and say thus saith the lord god a great eagle with great wings and long pinions full of feathers which had divers colours came unto lebanon and took the top of the cedar he cropped off the topmost of the young twigs thereof and carried it into a land of traffic he set it in a city of merchants he took also of the seed of the land and planted it in a fruitful soil he placed it beside many waters he set it as a slip and it grew and became a spreading vine of low stature whose tendrils might turn toward him and the roots thereof be under him so it became a vine and brought forth branches and shot forth sprigs there was also another great eagle with great wings and many feathers and behold this vine did bend its roots toward him and shot forth its branches toward him from the beds of its plantation that he might water it it was planted in a good soil by many waters that it might bring forth branches and that it might bear fruit that it might be a stately vine say thou thus saith the lord god shall it prosper shall he not pull up the roots thereof and cut off the fruit thereof that it wither yea wither in all its sprouting leaves neither shall great power or much people be at hand when it is plucked up by the roots thereof yea behold being planted shall it prosper shall it not utterly wither when the east wind toucheth it in the beds where it grew it shall wither  moreover the word of the lord came unto me saying say now to the rebellious house know ye not what these things mean tell them behold the king of babylon came to jerusalem and took the king thereof and the princes thereof and brought them to him to babylon and he took of the seed royal and made a covenant with him and brought him under an oath and the mighty of the land he took away that his might be a lowly kingdom that it might not lift itself up but that by keeping his covenant it might stand but he rebelled against him in sending his ambassadors into egypt that they might give him horses and much people shall he prosper shall he escape that doeth such things shall he break the covenant and yet escape as i live saith the lord god surely in the place where the king dwelleth that made him king whose oath he despised and whose covenant he broke even with him in the midst of babylon he shall die neither shall pharaoh with his mighty army and great company succour him in the war when they cast up mounds and build forts to cut off many souls seeing he hath despised the oath by breaking the covenant when lo he had given his hand and hath done all these things he shall not escape s therefore thus saith the lord god as i live surely mine oath that he hath despised and my covenant that he hath broken i will even bring it upon his own head and i will spread my net upon him and he shall be taken in my snare and i will bring him to babylon and will plead with him there for his treachery that he hath committed against me and all his mighty men in all his bands shall fall by the sword and they that remain shall be scattered toward every wind and ye shall know that i the lord have spoken it  thus saith the lord god moreover i will take even i of the lofty top of the cedar and will set it i will crop off from the topmost of its young twigs a tender one and i will plant it upon a high mountain and eminent in the mountain of the height of israel will i plant it and it shall bring forth boughs and bear fruit and be a stately cedar and under it shall dwell all fowl of every wing in the shadow of the branches thereof shall they dwell and all the trees of the field shall know that i the lord have brought down the high tree have exalted the low tree have dried up the green tree and have made the dry tree to flourish i the lord have spoken and have done it  and the word of the lord came unto me saying what mean ye that ye use this proverb in the land of israel saying the fathers have eaten so',\n",
       "  'ur grapes and the childrens teeth are set on edge as i live saith the lord god ye shall not have occasion any more to use this proverb in israel behold all souls are mine as the soul of the father so also the soul of the son is mine the soul that sinneth it shall die but if a man be just and do that which is lawful and right and hath not eaten upon the mountains neither hath lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of israel neither hath defiled his neighbours wife neither hath come near to a woman in her impurity and hath not wronged any but hath restored his pledge for a debt hath taken nought by robbery hath given his bread to the hungry and hath covered the naked with a garment he that hath not given forth upon interest neither hath taken any increase that hath withdrawn his hand from iniquity hath executed true justice between man and man hath walked in my statutes and hath kept mine ordinances to deal truly he is just he shall surely live saith the lord god if he beget a son that is a robber a shedder of blood and that doeth to a brother any of these things whereas he himself had not done any of these things for he hath even eaten upon the mountains and defiled his neighbours wife hath wronged the poor and needy hath taken by robbery hath not restored the pledge and hath lifted up his eyes to the idols hath committed abomination hath given forth upon interest and hath taken increase shall he then live he shall not livehe hath done all these abominations he shall surely be put to death his blood shall be upon him now lo if he beget a son that seeth all his fathers sins which he hath done and considereth and doeth not such like that hath not eaten upon the mountains neither hath lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of israel hath not defiled his neighbours wife neither hath wronged any hath not taken aught to pledge neither hath taken by robbery but hath given his bread to the hungry and hath covered the naked with a garment that hath withdrawn his hand from the poor that hath not received interest nor increase hath executed mine ordinances hath walked in my statutes he shall not die for the iniquity of his father he shall surely live as for his father because he cruelly oppressed committed robbery on his brother and did that which is not good among his people behold he dieth for his iniquity yet say ye why doth not the son bear the iniquity of the father with him when the son hath done that which is lawful and right and hath kept all my statutes and hath done them he shall surely live the soul that sinneth it shall die the son shall not bear the iniquity of the father with him neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son with him the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him s but if the wicked turn from all his sins that he hath committed and keep all my statutes and do that which is lawful and right he shall surely live he shall not die none of his transgressions that he hath committed shall be remembered against him for his righteousness that he hath done he shall live have i any pleasure at all that the wicked should die saith the lord god and not rather that he should return from his ways and live s but when the righteous turneth away from his righteousness and committeth iniquity and doeth according to all the abominations that the wicked man doeth shall he live none of his righteous deeds that he hath done shall be remembered for his trespass that he trespassed and for his sin that he hath sinned for them shall he die yet ye say the way of the lord is not equal hear now o house of israel is it my way that is not equal is it not your ways that are unequal when the righteous man turneth away from his righteousness and committeth iniquity he shall die therefor for his iniquity that he hath done shall he die s again when the wicked man turneth away from his wickedness that he hath committed and doeth that which is lawful and right he shall save his soul alive because he considereth and turneth away from all his transgressions that he hath committed he shall surely live he shall not die yet saith the house of israel the way of the lord is not equal o house of israel is it my ways that are not equal is it not your ways that are unequal therefore i will judge you o house of israel every one according to his ways saith the lord god return ye and turn yourselves from all your transgressions so shall they not be a stumblingblock of iniquity unto you cast away from you all your transgressions wherein ye have transgressed and make you a new heart and a new spirit for why will ye die o house of israel for i have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth saith the lord god wherefore turn yourselves and live  moreover take thou up a lamentation for the princes of israel and say how was thy mother a lioness among lions she couched in the midst of the young lions she reared her whelps and she brought up one of her whelps he became a young lion and he learned to catch the prey he devoured men then the nations assembled against him he was taken in their pit and they brought him with hooks unto the land of egypt now when she saw that she was disappointed and her hope was lost then she took another of her whelps and made him a young lion and he went up and down among the lions he became a young lion and he learned to catch the prey he devoured men and he knew their castles and laid waste their cities and the land was desolate and the fulness thereof because of the noise of his roaring then the nations cried out against him on every side from the provinces and they spread their net over him he was taken in their pit and they put him in a cage with hooks and brought him to the king of babylon that they might bring him into strongholds so that his voice should no more be heard upon the mountains of israel  thy mother was like a vine in thy likeness planted by the waters she was fruitful and full of branches by reason of many waters and she had strong rods to be sceptres for them that bore rule and her stature was exalted among the thick branches and she was seen in her height with the multitude of her tendrils but she was plucked up in fury she was cast down to the ground and the east wind dried up her fruit her strong rods were broken off and withered the fire consumed her and now she is planted in the wilderness in a dry and thirsty ground and fire is gone out of the rod of her branches it hath devoured her fruit so that there is in her no strong rod to be a sceptre to rule this is a lamentation and it was for a lamentation  and it came to pass in the seventh year in the fifth month the tenth day of the month that certain of the elders of israel came to inquire of the lord and sat before me s and the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man speak unto the elders of israel and say unto them thus saith the lord god are ye come to inquire of me as i live saith the lord god i will not be inquired of by you wilt thou judge them son of man wilt thou judge them cause them to know the abominations of their fathers and say unto them thus saith the lord god in the day when i chose israel and lifted up my hand unto the seed of the house of jacob and made myself known unto them in the land of egypt when i lifted up my hand unto them saying i am the lord your god in that day i lifted up my hand unto them to bring them forth out of the land of egypt into a land that i had sought out for them flowing with milk and honey which is the beauty of all lands and i said unto them cast ye away every man the detestable things of his eyes and defile not yourselves with the idols of egypt i am the lord your god but they rebelled against me and would not hearken unto me they did not every man cast away the detestable things of their eyes neither did they forsake the idols of egypt then i said i would pour out my fury upon them to spend my anger upon them in the midst of the land of egypt but i wrought for my names sake that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations among whom they were in whose sight i made myself known unto them so as to bring them forth out of the land of egypt so i caused them to go forth out of the land of egypt and brought them into the wilderness and i gave them my statutes and taught them mine ordinances which if a man do he shall live by them moreover also i gave them my sabbaths to be a sign between me and them that they might know that i am the lord that sanctify them but the house of israel rebelled against me in the wilderness they walked not in my statutes and they rejected mine ordinances which if a man do he shall live by them and my sabbaths they greatly profaned then i said i would pour out my fury upon them in the wilderness to consume them but i wrought for my names sake that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations in whose sight i brought them out yet also i lifted up my hand unto them in the wilderness that i would not bring them into the land which i had given them flowing with milk and honey which is the beauty of all lands because they rejected mine ordinances and walked not in my statutes and profaned my sabbathsfor their heart went after their idols nevertheless mine eye spared them from destroying them neither did i make a full end of them in the wilderness and i said unto their children in the wilderness walk ye not in the statutes of your fathers neither observe their ordinances nor defile yourselves with their idols i am the lord your god walk in my statutes and keep mine ordinances and do them and hallow my sabbaths and they shall be a sign between me and you that ye may know that i am the lord your god but the children rebelled against me they walked not in my statutes neither kept mine ordinances to do them which if a man do he shall live by them they profaned my sabbaths then i said i would pour out my fury upon them to spend my anger upon them in the wilderness nevertheless i withdr',\n",
       "  'ew my hand and wrought for my names sake that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations in whose sight i brought them forth i lifted up my hand unto them also in the wilderness that i would scatter them among the nations and disperse them through the countries because they had not executed mine ordinances but had rejected my statutes and had profaned my sabbaths and their eyes were after their fathers idols wherefore i gave them also statutes that were not good and ordinances whereby they should not live and i polluted them in their own gifts in that they set apart all that openeth the womb that i might destroy them to the end that they might know that i am the lord s therefore son of man speak unto the house of israel and say unto them thus saith the lord god in this moreover have your fathers blasphemed me in that they dealt treacherously with me for when i had brought them into the land which i lifted up my hand to give unto them then they saw every high hill and every thick tree and they offered there their sacrifices and there they presented the provocation of their offering there also they made their sweet savour and there they poured out their drinkofferings then i said unto them what meaneth the high place whereunto ye go so the name thereof is called bamah unto this day s wherefore say unto the house of israel thus saith the lord god when ye pollute yourselves after the manner of your fathers and go after their abominations and when in offering your gifts in making your sons to pass through the fire ye pollute yourselves with all your idols unto this day s shall i then be inquired of by you o house of israel as i live saith the lord god i will not be inquired of by you and that which cometh into your mind shall not be at all in that ye say we will be as the nations as the families of the countries to serve wood and stone as i live saith the lord god surely with a mighty hand and with an outstretched arm and with fury poured out will i be king over you and i will bring you out from the peoples and will gather you out of the countries wherein ye are scattered with a mighty hand and with an outstretched arm and with fury poured out and i will bring you into the wilderness of the peoples and there will i plead with you face to face like as i pleaded with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of egypt so will i plead with you saith the lord god and i will cause you to pass under the rod and i will bring you into the bond of the covenant and i will purge out from among you the rebels and them that transgress against me i will bring them forth out of the land where they sojourn but they shall not enter into the land of israel and ye shall know that i am the lord as for you o house of israel thus saith the lord god go ye serve every one his idols even because ye will not hearken unto me but my holy name shall ye no more profane with your gifts and with your idols for in my holy mountain in the mountain of the height of israel saith the lord god there shall all the house of israel all of them serve me in the land there will i accept them and there will i require your heaveofferings and the first of your gifts with all your holy things with your sweet savour will i accept you when i bring you out from the peoples and gather you out of the countries wherein ye have been scattered and i will be sanctified in you in the sight of the nations and ye shall know that i am the lord when i shall bring you into the land of israel into the country which i lifted up my hand to give unto your fathers and there shall ye remember your ways and all your doings wherein ye have polluted yourselves and ye shall loathe yourselves in your own sight for all your evils that ye have committed and ye shall know that i am the lord when i have wrought with you for my names sake not according to your evil ways nor according to your corrupt doings o ye house of israel saith the lord god  and the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man set thy face toward the south and preach toward the south and prophesy against the forest of the field in the south and say to the forest of the south hear the word of the lord thus saith the lord god behold i will kindle a fire in thee and it shall devour every green tree in thee and every dry tree it shall not be quenched even a flaming flame and all faces from the south to the north shall be seared thereby and all flesh shall see that i the lord have kindled it it shall not be quenched then said i ah lord god they say of me is he not a maker of parables  then the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man set thy face toward jerusalem and preach toward the sanctuaries and prophesy against the land of israel and say to the land of israel thus saith the lord behold i am against thee and will draw forth my sword out of its sheath and will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked seeing then that i will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked therefore shall my sword go forth out of its sheath against all flesh from the south to the north and all flesh shall know that i the lord have drawn forth my sword out of its sheath it shall not return any more s sigh therefore thou son of man with the breaking of thy loins and with bitterness shalt thou sigh before their eyes and it shall be when they say unto thee wherefore sighest thou that thou shalt say because of the tidings for it cometh and every heart shall melt and all hands shall be slack and every spirit shall be faint and all knees shall drip with water behold it cometh and it shall be done saith the lord god  and the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man prophesy and say thus saith the lord say a sword a sword it is sharpened and also furbished it is sharpened that it may make a sore slaughter it is furbished that it may glitteror shall we make mirthagainst the rod of my son contemning every tree and it is given to be furbished that it may be handled the sword it is sharpened yea it is furbished to give it into the hand of the slayer cry and wail son of man for it is upon my people it is upon all the princes of israel they are thrust down to the sword with my people smite therefore upon thy thigh for there is a trial and what if it contemn even the rod it shall be no more saith the lord god  thou therefore son of man prophesy and smite thy hands together and let the sword be doubled the third time the sword of those to be slain it is the sword of the great one that is to be slain which compasseth them about i have set the point of the sword against all their gates that their heart may melt and their stumblings be multiplied ah it is made glittering it is sharpened for slaughter go thee one way to the right or direct thyself to the left whither is thy face set i will also smite my hands together and i will satisfy my fury i the lord have spoken it  and the word of the lord came unto me saying now thou son of man make thee two ways that the sword of the king of babylon may come they twain shall come forth out of one land and mark a signpost mark it clear at the head of the way to the city thou shalt make a way that the sword may come to rabbah of the children of ammon and to judah in jerusalem the fortified for the king of babylon standeth at the parting of the way at the head of the two ways to use divination he shaketh the arrows to and fro he inquireth of the teraphim he looketh in the liver in his right hand is the lot jerusalem to set battering rams to open the mouth for the slaughter to lift up the voice with shouting to set battering rams against the gates to cast up mounds to build forts and it shall be unto them as a false divination in their sight who have weeks upon weeks but it bringeth iniquity to remembrance that they may be taken s therefore thus saith the lord god because ye have made your iniquity to be remembered in that your transgressions are uncovered so that your sins do appear in all your doings because that ye are come to remembrance ye shall be taken with the hand  and thou o wicked one that art to be slain the prince of israel whose day is come in the time of the iniquity of the end s thus saith the lord god the mitre shall be removed and the crown taken off this shall be no more the same that which is low shall be exalted and that which is high abased a ruin a ruin a ruin will i make it this also shall be no more until he come whose right it is and i will give it him  and thou son of man prophesy and say thus saith the lord god concerning the children of ammon and concerning their taunt and say thou o sword o sword keenedged furbished for the slaughter to the uttermost because of the glitterings while they see falsehood unto thee while they divine lies unto thee to lay thee upon the necks of the wicked that are to be slain whose day is come in the time of the iniquity of the end cause it to return into its sheathin the place where thou wast created in the land of thine origin will i judge thee and i will pour out my indignation upon thee i will blow upon thee with the fire of my wrath and i will deliver thee into the hand of brutish men skilful to destroy thou shalt be for fuel to the fire thy blood shall be in the midst of the land thou shalt be no more remembered for i the lord have spoken it  moreover the word of the lord came unto me saying now thou son of man wilt thou judge wilt thou judge the bloody city then cause her to know all her abominations and thou shalt say thus saith the lord god o city that sheddest blood in the midst of thee that thy time may come and that makest idols unto thyself to defile thee thou art become guilty in thy blood that thou hast shed and art defiled in thine idols which thou hast made and thou hast caused thy days to draw near and art come even unto thy years therefore have i made thee a reproach unto the nations and a mocking to all the countries those that are near and those that are far from thee shall mock thee thou defiled of name and fu',\n",

dealt by oppression with the stranger in thee have they wronged the fatherless and the widow thou hast despised my holy things and hast profaned my sabbaths in thee have been talebearers to shed blood and in thee they have eaten upon the mountains in the midst of thee they have committed lewdness in thee have they uncovered their fathers nakedness in thee have they humbled her that was unclean in her impurity and each hath committed abomination with his neighbours wife and each hath lewdly defiled his daughterinlaw and each in thee hath humbled his sister his fathers daughter in thee have they taken gifts to shed blood thou hast taken interest and increase and thou hast greedily gained of thy neighbours by oppression and hast forgotten me saith the lord god behold therefore i have smitten

you in and melt you yea i will gather you and blow upon you with the fire of my wrath and ye shall be melted in the midst thereof as silver is melted in the midst of the furnace so shall ye be melted in the midst thereof and ye shall know that i the lord have poured out my fury upon you  and the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man say unto her thou art a land that is not cleansed nor rained upon in the day of indignation there is a conspiracy of her prophets in the midst thereof like a roaring lion ravening the prey they have devoured souls they take treasure and precious things they have made her widows many in the midst thereof her priests have done violence to my law and have profaned my holy things they have put no difference between the holy and the common neither have they taught difference between the unclean and the clean and have hid their eyes from my sabbaths and i am profaned among them her princes in the midst thereof are like wolves ravening the prey to shed blood and to destroy souls so as to get dishonest gain and her prophets have daubed for them with whited plaster seeing falsehood and divining lies unto them saying thus saith the lord god when the lord hath not spoken the people of the land have used oppression and exercised robbery and have wronged the poor and needy and have oppressed the stranger unlawfully and i sought for a man among them that should make up the hedge and stand in the breach before me for the land that i should not destroy it but i found none therefore have i poured out mine indignation upon them i have consumed them with the fire of my wrath their own way have i brought upon their heads saith the lord god  and the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man there were two women the daughters of one mother and they committed harlotries in egypt they committed harlotries in their youth there were their bosoms pressed and there their virgin breasts were bruised and the names of them were oholah the elder and oholibah her sister and they became mine and they bore sons and daughters and as for their names samaria is oholah and jerusalem oholibah and oholah played the harlot when she was mine and she doted on her lovers on the assyrians warriors clothed with blue governors and rulers handsome young men all of them horsemen riding upon horses and she bestowed her harlotries upon them the choicest men of assyria all of them and on whomsoever she doted with all their idols she defiled herself neither hath she left her harlotries brought from egypt for in her youth they lay with her and they bruised her virgin breasts and they poured out their lust upon her wherefore i delivered her into the hand of her lovers into the hand of the assyrians upon whom she doted these uncovered her nakedness they took her sons and her daughters and her they slew with the sword and she became a byword among women for judgments were executed upon her s and her sister oholibah saw this yet was she more corrupt in her doting than she and in her harlotries more than her sister in her harlotries she doted upon the assyrians governors and rulers warriors clothed most gorgeously horsemen riding upon horses all of them handsome young men and i saw that she was defiled they both took one way and she increased her harlotries for she saw men portrayed upon the wall the images of the chaldeans portrayed with vermilion girded with girdles upon their loins with pendant turbans upon their heads all of them captains to look upon the likeness of the sons of babylon even of chaldea the land of their nativity and as soon as she saw them she doted upon them and sent messengers unto them into chaldea and the babylonians came to her into the bed of love and they defiled her with their lust and she was polluted with them and her soul was alienated from them so she uncovered her harlotries and uncovered her nakedness then my soul was alienated from her like as my soul was alienated from her sister yet she multiplied her harlotries remembering the days of her youth wherein she had played the harlot in the land of egypt and she doted upon concubinage with them whose flesh is as the flesh of asses and whose issue is like the issue of horses thus thou didst call to remembrance the lewdness of thy youth when they from egypt bruised thy breasts for the bosom of thy youth s therefore o oholibah thus saith the lord god behold i will raise up thy lovers against thee from whom thy soul is alienated and i will bring them against thee on every side the babylonians and all the chaldeans pekod and shoa and koa and all the assyrians with them handsome young men governors and rulers all of them captains and councillors all of them riding upon horses and they shall come against thee with hosts chariots and wheels and with an assembly of peoples they shall set themselves in array against thee with buckler and shield and helmet round about and i will commit the judgment unto them and they shall judge thee according to their judgments and i will set my jealousy against thee and they shall deal with thee in fury they shall take away thy nose and thine ears and thy residue shall fall by the sword they shall take thy sons and thy daughters and thy residue shall be devoured by the fire they shall also strip thee of thy clothes and take away thy fair jewels thus will i make thy lewdness to cease from thee and thy harlotry brought from the land of egypt so that thou shalt not lift up thine eyes unto them nor remember egypt any more  for thus saith the lord god behold i will deliver thee into the hand of them whom thou hatest into the hand of them from whom thy soul is alienated and they shall deal with thee in hatred and shall take away all thy labour and shall leave thee naked and bare and the nakedness of thy harlotries shall be uncovered both thy lewdness and thy harlotries these things shall be done unto thee for that thou hast gone astray after the nations and because thou art polluted with their idols in the way of thy sister hast thou walked therefore will i give her cup into thy hand s thus saith the lord god thou shalt drink of thy sisters cup which is deep and large thou shalt be for a scorn and a derision it is full to the uttermost thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and sorrow with the cup of astonishment and appalment with the cup of thy sister samaria thou shalt even drink it and drain it and thou shalt craunch the sherds thereof and shalt tear thy breasts for i have spoken it saith the lord god s therefore thus saith the lord god because thou hast forgotten me and cast me behind thy back therefore bear thou also thy lewdness and thy harlotries s the lord said moreover unto me son of man wilt thou judge oholah and oholibah then declare unto them their abominations for they have committed adultery and blood is in their hands and with their idols have they committed adultery and their sons whom they bore unto me they have also set apart unto them to be devoured moreover this they have done unto me they have defiled my sanctuary in the same day and have profaned my sabbaths for when they had slain their children to their idols then they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it and lo thus have they done in the midst of my house and furthermore ye have sent for men that come from far unto whom a messenger was sent and lo they came for whom thou didst wash thyself paint thine eyes and deck thyself with ornaments and sattest upon a stately bed with a table prepared before it whereupon thou didst set mine incense and mine oil and the voice of a multitude being at ease was therein and for the sake of men they were so many brought drunken from the wilderness they put bracelets upon their hands and beautiful crowns upon their heads then said i of her that was worn out by adulteries still they commit harlotries with her even her for every one went in unto her as men go in unto a harlot so went they in unto oholah and unto oholibah the lewd women but righteous men they sha',\n",
       "  'll judge them as adulteresses are judged and as women that shed blood are judged because they are adulteresses and blood is in their hands s for thus saith the lord god an assembly shall be brought up against them and they shall be made a horror and a spoil and the assembly shall stone them with stones and despatch them with their swords they shall slay their sons and their daughters and burn up their houses with fire thus will i cause lewdness to cease out of the land that all women may be taught not to do after your lewdness and your lewdness shall be recompensed upon you and ye shall bear the sins of your idols and ye shall know that i am the lord god  and the word of the lord came unto me in the ninth year in the tenth month in the tenth day of the month saying son of man write thee the name of the day even of this selfsame day this selfsame day the king of babylon hath invested jerusalem and utter a parable concerning the rebellious house and say unto them thus saith the lord god set on the pot set it on and also pour water into it gather into it the pieces belonging to it even every good piece the thigh and the shoulder fill it with the choice bones take the choice of the flock and pile also the bones under it make it boil well that the bones thereof may also be seethed in the midst of it s wherefore thus saith the lord god woe to the bloody city to the pot whose filth is therein and whose filth is not gone out of it bring it out piece by piece no lot is fallen upon it for her blood is in the midst of her she set it upon the bare rock she poured it not upon the ground to cover it with dust that it might cause fury to come up that vengeance might be taken i have set her blood upon the bare rock that it should not be covered  therefore thus saith the lord god woe to the bloody city i also will make the pile great heaping on the wood kindling the fire that the flesh may be consumed and preparing the mixture that the bones also may be burned then will i set it empty upon the coals thereof that it may be hot and the bottom thereof may burn and that the impurity of it may be molten in it that the filth of it may be consumed it hath wearied itself with toil yet its great filth goeth not forth out of it yea its noisome filth because of thy filthy lewdness because i have purged thee and thou wast not purged thou shalt not be purged from thy filthiness any more till i have satisfied my fury upon thee i the lord have spoken it it shall come to pass and i will do it i will not go back neither will i spare neither will i repent according to thy ways and according to thy doings shall they judge thee saith the lord god  also the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man behold i take away from thee the desire of thine eyes with a stroke yet neither shalt thou make lamentation nor weep neither shall thy tears run down sigh in silence make no mourning for the dead bind thy headtire upon thee and put thy shoes upon thy feet and cover not thine upper lip and eat not the bread of men so i spoke unto the people in the morning and at even my wife died and i did in the morning as i was commanded and the people said unto me wilt thou not tell us what these things are to us that thou doest so then i said unto them the word of the lord came unto me saying speak unto the house of israel thus saith the lord god behold i will profane my sanctuary the pride of your power the desire of your eyes and the longing of your soul and your sons and your daughters whom ye have left behind shall fall by the sword and ye shall do as i have done ye shall not cover your upper lips nor eat the bread of men and your tires shall be upon your heads and your shoes upon your feet ye shall not make lamentation nor weep but ye shall pine away in your iniquities and moan one toward another thus shall ezekiel be unto you a sign according to all that he hath done shall ye do when this cometh then shall ye know that i am the lord god s and thou son of man shall it not be in the day when i take from them their stronghold the joy of their glory the desire of their eyes and the yearning of their soul their sons and their daughters that in that day he that escapeth shall come unto thee to cause thee to hear it with thine ears in that day shall thy mouth be opened together with him that is escaped and thou shalt speak and be no more dumb so shalt thou be a sign unto them and they shall know that i am the lord  and the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man set thy face toward the children of ammon and prophesy against them and say unto the children of ammon hear the word of the lord god thus saith the lord god because thou saidst aha against my sanctuary when it was profaned and against the land of israel when it was made desolate and against the house of judah when they went into captivity therefore behold i will deliver thee to the children of the east for a possession and they shall set their encampments in thee and make their dwellings in thee they shall eat thy fruit and they shall drink thy milk and i will make rabbah a pasture for camels and the children of ammon a couchingplace for flocks and ye shall know that i am the lord  for thus saith the lord god because thou hast clapped thy hands and stamped with the feet and rejoiced with all the disdain of thy soul against the land of israel therefore behold i stretch out my hand upon thee and will deliver thee for a spoil to the nations and i will cut thee off from the peoples and i will cause thee to perish out of the countries i will destroy thee and thou shalt know that i am the lord  thus saith the lord god because that moab and seir do say behold the house of judah is like unto all the nations therefore behold i will open the flank of moab on the side of the cities on the side of his cities which are on his frontiers the beauteous country of bethjeshimoth baalmeon and kiriathaim together with the children of ammon unto the children of the east and i will give them for a possession that the children of ammon may not be remembered among the nations and i will execute judgments upon moab and they shall know that i am the lord  thus saith the lord god because that edom hath dealt against the house of judah by taking vengeance and hath greatly offended and revenged himself upon them therefore thus saith the lord god i will stretch out my hand upon edom and will cut off man and beast from it and i will make it desolate from teman even unto dedan shall they fall by the sword and i will lay my vengeance upon edom by the hand of my people israel and they shall do in edom according to mine anger and according to my fury and they shall know my vengeance saith the lord god thus saith the lord god because the philistines have dealt by revenge and have taken vengeance with disdain of soul to destroy for the old hatred therefore thus saith the lord god behold i will stretch out my hand upon the philistines and i will cut off the cherethites and destroy the remnant of the seacoast and i will execute great vengeance upon them with furious rebukes and they shall know that i am the lord when i shall lay my vengeance upon them  and it came to pass in the eleventh year in the first day of the month that the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man because that tyre hath said against jerusalem aha she is broken that was the gate of the peoples she is turned unto me i shall be filled with her that is laid waste therefore thus saith the lord god behold i am against thee o tyre and will cause many nations to come up against thee as the sea causeth its waves to come up and they shall destroy the walls of tyre and break down her towers i will also scrape her dust from her and make her a bare rock she shall be a place for the spreading of nets in the midst of the sea for i have spoken it saith the lord god and she shall become a spoil to the nations and her daughters that are in the field shall be slain with the sword and they shall know that i am the lord  for thus saith the lord god behold i will bring upon tyre nebuchadrezzar king of babylon king of kings from the north with horses and with chariots and with horsemen and a company and much people he shall slay with the sword thy daughters in the field and he shall make forts against thee and cast up a mound against thee and set up bucklers against thee and he shall set his battering engines against thy walls and with his axes he shall break down thy towers by reason of the abundance of his horses their dust shall cover thee at the noise of the horsemen and of the wheels and of the chariots thy walls shall shake when he shall enter into thy gates as men enter into a city wherein is made a breach with the hoofs of his horses shall he tread down all thy streets he shall slay thy people with the sword and the pillars of thy strength shall go down to the ground and they shall make a spoil of thy riches and make a prey of thy merchandise and they shall break down thy walls and destroy the houses of thy delight and thy stones and thy timber and thy dust shall they lay in the midst of the waters and i will cause the noise of thy songs to cease and the sound of thy harps shall be no more heard and i will make thee a bare rock thou shalt be a place for the spreading of nets thou shalt be built no more for i the lord have spoken saith the lord god s thus saith the lord god to tyre shall not the isles shake at the sound of thy fall when the wounded groan when the slaughter is made in the midst of thee then all the princes of the sea shall come down from their thrones and lay away their robes and strip off their richly woven garments they shall clothe themselves with trembling they shall sit upon the ground and shall tremble every moment and be appalled at thee and they shall take up a lamentation for thee and say to thee how art thou destroyed that wast peopled from the seas the renowned city that wast strong in the sea thou and thy inhabitants that caused your terror',\n",
       "  ' to be on all that inhabit the earth now shall the isles tremble in the day of thy fall yea the isles that are in the sea shall be affrighted at thy going out s for thus saith the lord god when i shall make thee a desolate city like the cities that are not inhabited when i shall bring up the deep upon thee and the great waters shall cover thee then will i bring thee down with them that descend into the pit to the people of old time and will make thee to dwell in the nether parts of the earth like the places that are desolate of old with them that go down to the pit that thou be not inhabited and i will set glory in the land of the living i will make thee a terror and thou shalt be no more though thou be sought for yet shalt thou never be found again saith the lord god  moreover the word of the lord came unto me saying and thou son of man take up a lamentation for tyre and say unto tyre that dwelleth at the entry of the sea that is the merchant of the peoples unto many isles s thus saith the lord god thou o tyre hast said i am of perfect beauty thy borders are in the heart of the seas thy builders have perfected thy beauty of cypresstrees from senir have they fashioned all thy planks they have taken cedars from lebanon to make masts for thee of the oaks of bashan have they made thine oars thy deck have they made of ivory inlaid in larch from the isles of the

thy walls round about and the gammadim were in thy towers they hanged their shields upon thy walls round about they have perfected thy beauty tarshish was thy merchant by reason of the multitude of all kinds of riches with silver iron tin and lead they traded for thy wares javan tubal and meshech they were thy traffickers they traded the persons of men and vessels of brass for thy merchandise they of the house of togarmah traded for thy wares with horses and horsemen and mules the men of dedan were thy traffickers many isles were the mart of thy hand they brought thee as tribute horns of

traffic these were thy traffickers in gorgeous fabrics in wrappings of blue and richly woven work and in chests of rich apparel bound with cords and cedarlined among thy merchandise the ships of tarshish brought thee tribute for thy merchandise so wast thou replenished and made very heavy in the heart of the seas thy rowers have brought thee into great waters the east wind hath broken thee in the heart of the seas thy riches and thy wares thy merchandise thy mariners and thy pilots thy calkers and the exchangers of thy merchandise and all thy men of war that are in thee with all thy company which is in the midst of thee shall fall into the heart of the seas in the day of thy ruin at the sound of the cry of thy pilots the waves shall shake and all that handle the oar the mariners and all the pilots of the sea shall come down from their ships they shall stand upon the land and shall cause their voice to be heard over thee and shall cry bitterly and shall cast up dust upon their heads they shall roll themselves in the ashes and they shall make themselves utterly bald for thee and gird them with sackcloth and they shall weep for thee in bitterness of soul with bitter lamentation and in their wailing they shall take up a lamentation for thee and lament over thee who was there like tyre fortified in the midst of the sea when thy wares came forth out of the seas thou didst fill many peoples with the multitude of thy riches and of thy merchandise didst thou enrich the kings of the earth now that thou art broken by the seas in the depths of the waters and thy merchandise and all thy company are fallen in the midst of thee all the inhabitants of the isles are appalled at thee and their kings are horribly afraid they are troubled in their countenance the merchants among the peoples hiss at thee thou art become a terror and never shalt be any more  and the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man say unto the prince of tyre thus saith the lord god because thy heart is lifted up and thou hast said i am a god i sit in the seat of god in the heart of the seas yet thou art man and not god though thou didst set thy heart as the heart of god behold thou art wiser than daniel there is no secret that they can hide from thee by thy wisdom and by thy discernment thou hast gotten thee riches and hast gotten gold and silver into thy treasures in thy great wisdom by thy traffic hast thou increased thy riches and thy heart is lifted up because of thy riches s therefore thus saith the lord god because thou hast set thy heart as the heart of god therefore behold i will bring strangers upon thee the terrible of the nations and they shall draw their swords against the beauty of thy wisdom and they shall defile thy brightness they shall bring thee down to the pit and thou shalt die the deaths of them that are slain in the heart of the seas wilt thou yet say before him that slayeth thee i am god but thou art man and not god in the hand of them that defile thee thou shalt die the deaths of the uncircumcised by the hand of strangers for i have spoken saith the lord god  moreover the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man take up a lamentation for the king of tyre and say unto him thus saith the lord god thou seal most accurate full of wisdom and perfect in beauty thou wast in eden the garden of god every precious stone was thy covering the carnelian the topaz and the emerald the beryl the onyx and the jasper the sapphire the carbuncle and the smaragd and gold the workmanship of thy settings and of thy sockets was in thee in the day that thou wast created they were prepared thou wast the farcovering cherub and i set thee so that thou wast upon the holy mountain of god thou hast walked up and down in the midst of stones of fire thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created till unrighteousness was found in thee by the multitude of thy traffic they filled the midst of thee with violence and thou hast sinned therefore have i cast thee as profane out of the mountain of god and i have destroyed thee o covering cherub from the midst of the stones of fire thy heart was lifted up because of thy beauty thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness i have cast thee to the ground i have laid thee before kings that they may gaze upon thee by the multitude of thine iniquities in the unrighteousness of thy traffic thou hast profaned thy sanctuaries therefore have i brought forth a fire from the midst of thee it hath devoured thee and i have turned thee to ashes upon the earth in the sight of all them that behold thee all they that know thee among the peoples shall be appalled at thee thou art become a terror and thou shalt never be any more  and the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man set thy face toward zidon and prophesy against it and say thus saith the lord god behold i am against thee o zidon and i will be glorified in the midst of thee

fall in the midst of her by the sword upon her on every side and they shall know that i am the lord and there shall be no more a pricking brier unto the house of israel nor a piercing thorn of any that are round about them that did have them in disdain and they shall know that i am the lord god  thus saith the lord god when i shall have gathered the house of israel from the peoples among whom they are scattered and shall be sanctified in them in the sight of the nations then shall they dwell in their own land which i gave to my servant jacob and they shall dwell safely therein and shall build houses and plant vineyards yea they shall dwell safely when i have executed judgments upon all those that have them in disdain round about them and they shall know that i am the lord their god  in the tenth year in the tenth month in the twelfth day of the month the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man set thy face against pharaoh king of egypt and prophesy against him and against all egypt speak and say thus saith the lord god behold i am against thee pharaoh king of egypt the great dragon that lieth in the midst of his rivers that hath said my river is mine own and i have made it for myself and i will put hooks in thy jaws and i will cause the fish of thy rivers to st',\n",

the fish of thy rivers thou shalt fall upon the open field thou shalt not be brought together nor gathered to the beasts of the earth and to the fowls of the heaven have i given thee for food and all the inhabitants of egypt shall know that i am the lord because they have been a staff of reed to the house of israel when they take hold of thee with the hand thou dost break and rend all their shoulders and when they lean upon thee thou breakest and makest all their loins to be at a stand s therefore thus saith the lord god behold i will bring a sword upon thee and will cut off from thee man and beast and the land of egypt shall be desolate and waste and they shall know that i am the lord because he hath said the river is mine and i have made it therefore behold i am against thee and against thy rivers and i will make the land of egypt utterly waste and desolate from migdol to syene even unto the border of ethiopia no foot of man shall pass through it nor foot of beast shall pass through it neither shall it be inhabited forty years and i will make the land of egypt desolate in the midst of the countries that are desolate and her cities among the cities that are laid waste shall be desolate forty years and i will scatter the egyptians among the nations and will disperse them through the countries s for thus saith the lord god at the end of forty years will i gather the egyptians from the peoples whither they were scattered and i will turn the captivity of egypt and will cause them to return into the land of pathros into the land of their origin and they shall be there a lowly kingdom it shall be the lowliest of the kingdoms neither shall it any more lift itself up above the nations and i will diminish them that they shall no more rule over the nations and it shall be no more the confidence of the house of israel bringing iniquity to remembrance when they turn after them and they shall know that i am the lord god  and it came to pass in the seven and twentieth year in the first month in the first day of the month the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man nebuchadrezzar king of babylon caused his army to serve a great service against tyre every head was made bald and every shoulder was peeled yet had he no wages nor his army from tyre for the service that he had served against it s therefore thus saith the lord god behold i will give the land of egypt unto nebuchadrezzar king of babylon and he shall carry off her abundance and take her spoil and take her prey and it shall be the wages for his army i have given him the land of egypt as his hire for which he served because they wrought for me saith the lord god in that day will i cause a horn to shoot up unto the house of israel and i will give thee the opening of the mouth in the midst of them and they shall know that i am the lord  and the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man prophesy and say thus saith the lord god wail ye woe worth the day for the day is near even the day of the lord is near a day of clouds it shall be the time of the nations and a sword shall come upon egypt and convulsion shall be in ethiopia when the slain shall fall in egypt and they shall take away her abundance and her foundation shall be broken down ethiopia and put and lud and all the mingled people and cub and the children of the land that is in league shall fall with them by the sword  thus saith the lord they also that uphold egypt shall fall and the pride of her power shall come down from migdol to syene shall they fall in it by the sword saith the lord god and they shall be desolate in the midst of the countries that are desolate and her cities shall be in the midst of the cities that are wasted and they shall know that i am the lord when i have set a fire in egypt and all her helpers are destroyed in that day shall messengers go forth from before me in ships to make the confident ethiopians afraid and there shall come convulsion upon them in the day of egypt for lo it cometh s thus saith the lord god i will also make the multitude of egypt to cease by the hand of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon he and his people with him the terrible of the nations shall be brought in to destroy the land and they shall draw their swords against egypt and fill the land with the slain and i will make the rivers dry and will give the land over into the hand of evil men and i will make the land desolate and all that is therein by the hand of strangers i the lord have spoken it s thus saith the lord god i will also destroy the idols and i will cause the things of nought to cease from noph and there shall be no more a prince out of the land of egypt and i will put a fear in the land of egypt and i will make pathros desolate and will set a fire in zoan and will execute judgments in no and i will pour my fury upon sin the stronghold of egypt and i will cut off the multitude of no and i will set a fire in egypt sin shall be in great convulsion and no shall be rent asunder and in noph shall come adversaries in the daytime the young men of aven and of pibeseth shall fall by the sword and these cities shall go into captivity at tehaphnehes also the day shall withdraw itself when i shall break there the yokes of egypt and the pride of her power shall cease in her as for her a cloud shall cover her and her daughters shall go into captivity thus will i execute judgments in egypt and they shall know that i am the lord  and it came to pass in the eleventh year in the first month in the seventh day of the month that the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man i have broken the arm of pharaoh king of egypt and lo it hath not been bound up to be healed to put a roller that it be bound up and wax strong that it hold the sword s therefore thus saith the lord god behold i am against pharaoh king of egypt and will break his arms the strong and that which was broken and i will cause the sword to fall out of his hand and i will scatter the egyptians among the nations and will disperse them through the countries and i will strengthen the arms of the king of babylon and put my sword in his hand but i will break the arms of pharaoh and he shall groan before him with the groanings of a deadly wounded man and i will hold up the arms of the king of babylon and the arms of pharaoh shall fall down and they shall know that i am the lord when i shall put my sword into the hand of the king of babylon and he shall stretch it out upon the land of egypt and i will scatter the egyptians among the nations and disperse them through the countries and they shall know that i am the lord  and it came to pass in the eleventh year in the third month in the first day of the month that the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man say unto pharaoh king of egypt and to his multitude whom art thou like in thy greatness behold the assyrian was a cedar in lebanon with fair branches and with a shadowing shroud and of a high stature and its top was among the thick boughs the waters nourished it the deep made it to grow her rivers ran round about her plantation and she sent out her conduits unto all the trees of the field therefore its stature was exalted above all the trees of the field and its boughs were multiplied and its branches became long because of the multitude of waters when it shot them forth all the fowls of heaven made their nests in its boughs and all the beasts of the field did bring forth their young under its branches and under its shadow dwelt all great nations thus was it fair in its greatness in the length of its branches for its root was by many waters the cedars in the garden of god could not hide it the cypresstrees were not like its boughs and the planetrees were not as its branches nor was any tree in the garden of god like unto it in its beauty i made it fair by the multitude of its branches so that all the trees of eden that were in the garden of god envied it  therefore thus saith the lord god because thou art exalted in stature and he hath set his top among the thick boughs and his heart is lifted up in his height i do even deliver him into the hand of the mighty one of the nations he shall surely deal with him i do drive him out according to his wickedness and strangers the terrible of the nations do cut him off and cast him down upon the mountains and in all the valleys his branches are fallen and his boughs lie broken in all the channels of the land and all the peoples of the earth do go down from his shadow and do leave him upon his carcass all the fowls of the heaven do dwell and upon his branches are all the beasts of the field to the end that none of all the trees by the waters exalt themselves in their stature neither set their top among the thick boughs nor that their mighty ones stand up in their height even all that drink water for they are all delivered unto death to the nether parts of the earth in the midst of the children of men with them that go down to the pit  thus saith the lord god in the day when he went down to the netherworld i caused the deep to mourn and cover itself for him and i restrained the rivers thereof and the great waters were stayed and i caused lebanon to mourn for him and all the trees of the field fainted for him i made the nations to shake at the sound of his fall when i cast him down to the netherworld with them that descend into the pit and all the trees of eden the choice and best of lebanon all that drink water were comforted in the nether parts of the earth they also went down into the netherworld with him unto them that are slain by the sword yea they that were in his arm that dwelt under his shadow in the midst of the nations to whom art thou thus like in glory and in greatness among the trees of eden yet shall thou be brought down with the trees of eden unto th',\n",

pass in the twelfth year in the twelfth month in the first day of the month that the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man take up a lamentation for pharaoh king of egypt and say unto him thou didst liken thyself unto a young lion of the nations whereas thou art as a dragon in the seas and thou didst gush forth with thy rivers and didst trouble the waters with thy feet and foul their rivers s thus saith the lord god i will therefore spread out my net over thee with a company of many peoples and they shall bring thee up in my net and i will cast thee upon the land i will hurl thee upon the open field and will cause all the fowls of the heaven to settle upon thee and i will fill the beasts of the whole earth with thee and i will lay thy flesh upon the mountains and fill the valleys with thy foulness i will also water with thy blood the land wherein thou swimmest even to the mountains and the channels shall be full of thee and when i shall extinguish thee i will cover the heaven and make the stars thereof black i will cover the sun with a cloud and the moon shall not give her light all the bright lights of heaven will i make black over thee and set darkness upon thy land saith the lord god i will also vex the hearts of many peoples when i shall bring thy destruction among the nations into the countries which thou hast not known yea i will make many peoples appalled at thee and their kings shall be horribly afraid for thee when i shall brandish my sword before them and they shall tremble at every moment every man for his own life in the day of thy fall  for thus saith the lord god the sword of the king of babylon shall come upon thee by the swords of the mighty will i cause thy multitude to fall the terrible of the nations are they all and they shall spoil the pride of egypt and all the multitude thereof shall be destroyed i will destroy also all the beasts thereof from beside many waters neither shall the foot of man trouble them any more nor the hoofs of beasts trouble them then will i make their waters to settle and cause their rivers to run like oil saith the lord god when i shall make the land of egypt desolate and waste a land destitute of that whereof it was full when i shall smite all them that dwell therein then shall they know that i am the lord this is the lamentation wherewith they shall lament the daughters of the nations shall lament therewith for egypt and for all her multitude shall they lament therewith saith the lord god  it came to pass also in the twelfth year in the fifteenth day of the month that the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man wail for the multitude of egypt and cast them down even her with the daughters of the mighty nations unto the nether parts of the earth with them that go down into the pit whom dost thou pass in beauty go down and be thou laid with the uncircumcised they shall fall in the midst of them that are slain by the sword she is delivered to the sword draw her down and all her multitudes the strong among the mighty shall speak of him out of the midst of the netherworld with them that helped him they are gone down they lie still even the uncircumcised slain by the sword asshur is there and all her company their graves are round about them all of them slain fallen by the sword whose graves are set in the uttermost parts of the pit and her company is round about her grave all of them slain fallen by the sword who caused terror in the land of the living there is elam and all her multitude round about her grave all of them slain fallen by the sword who are gone down uncircumcised into the nether parts of the earth who caused their terror in the land of the living yet have they borne their shame with them that go down to the pit they have set her a bed in the midst of the slain with all her multitude her graves are round about them all of them uncircumcised slain by the sword because their terror was caused in the land of the living yet have they borne their shame with them that go down to the pit they are put in the midst of them that are slain there is meshech tubal and all her multitude her graves are round about them all of them uncircumcised slain by the sword because they caused their terror in the land of the living and they that are inferior to the uncircumcised shall not lie with the mighty that are gone down to the netherworld with their weapons of war whose swords are laid under their heads and whose iniquities are upon their bones because the terror of the mighty was in the land of the living but thou in the midst of the uncircumcised shalt thou be broken and lie even with them that are slain by the sword there is edom her kings and all her princes who for all their might are laid with them that are slain by the sword they shall lie with the uncircumcised and with them that go down to the pit there are the princes of the north all of them and all the zidonians who are gone down with the slain ashamed for all the terror which they caused by their might and they lie uncircumcised with them that are slain by the sword and bear their shame with them that go down to the pit these shall pharaoh see and shall be comforted over all his multitude even pharaoh and all his army slain by the sword saith the lord god for i have put my terror in the land of the living and he shall be laid in the midst of the uncircumcised with them that are slain by the sword even pharaoh and all his multitude saith the lord god  and the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man speak to the children of thy people and say unto them when i bring the sword upon a land if the people of the land take a man from among them and set him for their watchman if when he seeth the sword come upon the land he blow the horn and warn the people then whosoever heareth the sound of the horn and taketh not warning if the sword come and take him away his blood shall be upon his own head he heard the sound of the horn and took not warning his blood shall be upon him whereas if he had taken warning he would have delivered his soul but if the watchman see the sword come and blow not the horn and the people be not warned and the sword do come and take any person from among them he is taken away in his iniquity but his blood will i require at the watchmans hand  so thou son of man i have set thee a watchman unto the house of israel therefore when thou shalt hear the word at my mouth warn them from me when i say unto the wicked o wicked man thou shalt surely die and thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way that wicked man shall die in his iniquity but his blood will i require at thy hand nevertheless if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it and he turn not from his way he shall die in his iniquity but thou hast delivered thy soul  therefore o thou son of man say unto the house of israel thus ye speak saying our transgressions and our sins are upon us and we pine away in them how then can we live say unto them as i live saith the lord god i have no pleasure in the death of the wicked but that the wicked turn from his way and live turn ye turn ye from your evil ways for why will ye die o house of israel  and thou son of man say unto the children of thy people the righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him in the day of his transgression and as for the wickedness of the wicked he shall not stumble thereby in the day that he turneth from his wickedness neither shall he that is righteous be able to live thereby in the day that he sinneth when i say to the righteous that he shall surely live if he trust to his righteousness and commit iniquity none of his righteous deeds shall be remembered but for his iniquity that he hath committed for it shall he die again when i say unto the wicked thou shalt surely die if he turn from his sin and do that which is lawful and right if the wicked restore the pledge give back that which he had taken by robbery walk in the statutes of life committing no iniquity he shall surely live he shall not die none of his sins that he hath committed shall be remembered against him he hath done that which is lawful and right he shall surely live yet the children of thy people say the way of the lord is not equal but as for them their way is not equal when the righteous turneth from his righteousness and committeth iniquity he shall even die thereby and when the wicked turneth from his wickedness and doeth that which is lawful and right he shall live thereby yet ye say the way of the lord is not equal o house of israel i will judge you every one after his ways  and it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity in the tenth month in the fifth day of the month that one that had escaped out of jerusalem came unto me saying the city is smitten now the hand of the lord had been upon me in the evening before he that was escaped came and he had opened my mouth against his coming to me in the morning and my mouth was opened and i was no more dumb  then the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man they that inhabit those waste places in the land of israel speak saying abraham was one and he inherited the land but we are many the land is given us for inheritance s wherefore say unto them thus saith the lord god ye eat with the blood and lift up your eyes unto your idols and shed blood and shall ye possess the land ye stand upon your sword ye work abomination and ye defile every one his neighbours wife and shall ye possess the land s thus shalt thou say unto them thus saith the lord god as i live surely they that are in the waste places shall fall by the sword and him that is in the open field will i give to the beasts to be devoured and they that are in the strongholds and in the caves shall die of the pestilence and i will make the land most desolate and ',\n",

thy words but do them notfor with their mouth they show much love but their heart goeth after their covetousness and lo thou art unto them as a love song of one that hath a pleasant voice and can play well on an instrument so they hear thy words but they do them not when this cometh to passbehold it comeththen shall they know that a prophet hath been among them  and the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man prophesy against the shepherds of israel prophesy and say unto them even to the shepherds thus saith the lord god woe unto the shepherds of israel that have fed themselves should not the shepherds feed the sheep ye did eat the fat and ye clothed you with the wool ye killed the fatlings but ye fed not the sheep the weak have ye not strengthened neither have ye healed that which was sick neither have ye bound up that which was broken neither have ye brought back that which was driven away neither have ye sought that which was lost but with force have ye ruled over them and with rigour so were they scattered because there was no shepherd and they became food to all the beasts of the field and were scattered my sheep wandered through all the mountains and upon every high hill yea upon all the face of the earth were my sheep scattered and there was none that did search or seek therefore ye shepherds hear the word of the lord as i live saith the lord god surely forasmuch as my sheep became a prey and my sheep became food to all the beasts of the field because there was no shepherd neither did my shepherds search for my sheep but the shepherds fed themselves and fed not my sheep therefore ye shepherds hear the word of the lord thus saith the lord god behold i am against the shepherds and i will require my sheep at their hand and cause them to cease from feeding the sheep neither shall the shepherds feed themselves any more and i will deliver my sheep from their mouth that they may not be food for them s for thus saith the lord god behold here am i and i will search for my sheep and seek them out as a shepherd seeketh out his flock in the day that he is among his sheep that are separated so will i seek out my sheep and i will deliver them out of all places whither they have been scattered in the day of clouds and thick darkness and i will bring them out from the peoples and gather them from the countries and will bring them into their own land and i will feed them upon the mountains of israel by the streams and in all the habitable places of the country i will feed them in a good pasture and upon the high mountains of israel shall their fold be there shall they lie down in a good fold and in a fat pasture shall they feed upon the mountains of israel i will feed my sheep and i will cause them to lie down saith the lord god i will seek that which was lost and will bring back that which was driven away and will bind up that which was broken and will strengthen that which was sick and the fat and the strong i will destroy i will feed them in justice and as for you o my flock thus saith the lord god behold i judge between cattle and cattle even the rams and the hegoats seemeth it a small thing unto you to have fed upon the good pasture but ye must tread down with your feet the residue of your pasture and to have drunk of the settled waters but ye must foul the residue with your feet and as for my sheep they eat that which ye have trodden with your feet and they drink that which ye have fouled with your feet  therefore thus saith the lord god unto them behold i even i will judge between the fat cattle and the lean cattle because ye thrust with side and with shoulder and push all the weak with your horns till ye have scattered them abroad therefore will i save my flock and they shall no more be a prey and i will judge between cattle and cattle and i will set up one shepherd over them and he shall feed them even my servant david he shall feed them and he shall be their shepherd and i the lord will be their god and my servant david prince among them i the lord have spoken and i will make with them a covenant of peace and will cause evil beasts to cease out of the land and they shall dwell safely in the

prepare thee unto blood and blood shall pursue thee surely thou hast hated thine own blood therefore blood shall pursue thee thus will i make mount seir most desolate and cut off from it him that passeth through and him that returneth and i will fill his mountains with his slain in thy hills and in thy valleys and in all thy streams shall they fall that are slain with the sword i will make thee perpetual desolations and thy cities shall not return and ye shall know that i am the lord because thou hast said these two nations and these two countries shall be mine and we will possess it

myself known among them when i shall judge thee and thou shalt know that i the lord have heard all thy blasphemies which thou hast spoken against the mountains of israel saying they are laid desolate they are given us to devour and ye have magnified yourselves against me with your mouth and have multiplied your words against me i have heard it s thus saith the lord god when the whole earth rejoiceth i will make thee desolate as thou didst rejoice over the inheritance of the house of israel because it was desolate so will i do unto thee thou shalt be desolate o mount seir and all edom

prey and derision to the residue of the nations that are round about therefore thus saith the lord god surely in the fire of my jealousy have i spoken against the residue of the nations and against

it by their way and by their doings their way before me was as the uncleanness of a woman in her impurity wherefore i poured out my fury upon them for the blood which they had shed upon the land and because they had defiled it with their idols and i scattered them among the nations and they were dispersed through the countries according to their way and according to their doings i judged them and when they came unto the nations whither they came they profaned my holy name in that men said of them these are the people of the lord and are gone forth out of his land but i had pity for my holy name which the house of israel had profaned among the nations whither they came  therefore say unto the house of israel thus saith the lord god i do not this for your sake o house of israel but for my holy name which ye have profaned among the nations whither ye came and i will sanctify my great name which hath been profaned among the nations which ye have profaned in the midst of them and the nations shall know that i am the lord saith the lord god when i shall be sanctified in you before their eyes for i will take you from among the nations and gather you out of all the countries and will bring you into your own land and i will sprinkle clean water upon you and ye shall be clean from all your uncleannesses and from all your idols will i cleanse you a new heart also will i give you and

uncleannesses and i will call for the corn and will increase it and lay no famine upon you and i will multiply the fruit of the tree and the increase of the field that ye may receive no more the reproach of famine among the nations then shall ye remember your evil ways and your doings that were not good and ye shall loathe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities and for your abominations not for your sake do i this saith the lord god be it known unto you be ashamed and confounded for your ways o house of israel s thus saith the lord god in the day that i cleanse you from all your iniquities i will cause the cities to be inhabited and the waste places shall be builded and the land that was desolate shall be tilled whereas it was a desolation in the sight of all that passed by and they shall say this land that was desolate is become like the garden of eden and the waste and desolate and ruined cities are fortified and inhabited then the nations that are left round about you shall know that i the lord have builded the ruined places and planted that which was desolate i the lord have spoken it and i will do it s thus saith the lord god i will yet for this be inquired of by the house of israel to do it for them i will increase them with men like a flock as the flock for sacrifice as the flock of jerusalem in her appointed seasons so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of men and they shall know that i am the lord  the hand of the lord was upon me and the lord carried me out in a spirit and set me down in the midst of the valley and it was full of bones and he caused me to pass by them round about and behold there were very many in the open valley and lo they were very dry and he said unto me son of man can these bones live and i answered o lord god thou knowest then he said unto me prophesy over these bones and say unto them o ye dry bones hear the word of the lord thus saith the lord god unto these bones behold i will cause breath to enter into you and ye shall live and i will lay sinews upon you and will bring up flesh upon you and cover you with skin and put breath in you and ye shall live and ye shall know that i am the lord so i prophesied as i was commanded and as i prophesied there was a noise and behold a commotion and the bones came together bone to its bone and i beheld and lo there were sinews upon them and flesh came up and skin covered them above but there was no breath in them then said he unto me prophesy unto the breath prophesy son of man and say to the breath s thus saith the lord god come from the four winds o breath and breathe upon these slain that they may live so i prophesied as he commanded me and the breath came into them and they lived and stood up upon their feet an exceeding great host then

the lord god behold i will open your graves and cause you to come up out of your graves o my people and i will bring you into the land of israel and ye shall know that i am the lord when i have opened your graves and caused you to come up out of your graves o my people and i will put my spirit in you and ye shall live and i will place you in your own land and ye shall know that i the lord have spoken and performed it saith the lord  and the word of the lord came unto me saying and thou son of man take thee one stick and write upon it for judah and for the children of israel his companions

on magog and on them that dwell safely in the isles and they shall know that i am the lord and my holy name will i make known in the midst of my people israel neither will i suffer my holy name to be profaned any more and the nations shall know that i am the lord the holy one in israel behold it cometh and it shall be done saith the lord god this is the day whereof i have spoken and they that dwell in the cities of israel shall go forth and shall make fires of the weapons and use them as fuel both the shields and the bucklers the bows and the arrows and the handstaves and the spears and they shall make fires of them seven years so that they shall take no wood out of the field neither cut down any out of the forests for they shall make fires of the weapons and they shall spoil those that spoiled them and rob those that robbed them saith the lord god s and it shall come to pass in that day that i will give unto gog a place fit for burial in israel the valley of them that pass through on the east of the sea and it shall stop them that pass through and there shall they bury gog and all his multitude and they shall call it the valley of hamongog and seven months shall the house of israel be burying them that they may cleanse the land yea all the people of the land shall bury them and it shall be to them a renown in the day that i shall be glorified saith the lord god

seven months shall they search and when they that pass through shall pass through the land and any seeth a mans bone then shall he set up a sign by it till the buriers have buried it in the valley of hamongog and hamonah shall also be the name of a city thus shall they cleanse the land  and thou son of man thus saith the lord god speak unto the birds of every sort and to every beast of the field assemble yourselves and come gather yourselves on every side to my feast that i do prepare for you even a great feast upon the mountains of israel that ye may eat flesh and drink blood the flesh of the mighty shall ye eat and the blood of the princes of the earth shall ye drink rams lambs and goats bullocks fatlings of bashan are they all of them and ye shall eat fat till ye be full and drink blood till ye be drunken of my feast which i have prepared for you and ye shall be filled at my table with horses and horsemen with mighty men and with all men of war saith the lord god and i will set my glory among the nations and all the nations shall see my judgment that i have executed and my hand that i have laid upon them so the house of israel shall know that i am the lord their god from that day and forward and the nations shall know that the house of israel went into captivity for their iniquity because they broke faith with me and i hid my face from them so i gave them into the hand of their adversaries and they fell all of them by the sword according to their uncleanness and according to their transgressions did i unto them and i hid my face from them s therefore thus saith

visions were like the vision that i saw by the river chebar and i fell upon my face and the glory of the lord came into the house by the way of the gate whose prospect is toward the east and a spirit took me up and brought me into the inner court and behold the glory of the lord filled the house and i heard one speaking unto me out of the house and a man stood by me and he said unto me son of man this is the place of my throne and the place of the soles of my feet where i will dwell in the midst of the children of israel for ever and the house of israel shall no more defile my holy name neither they nor their kings by their harlotry and by the carcasses of their kings in their high places in their setting of their threshold by my threshold and their doorpost beside my doorpost and there was but the wall between me and them and they have defiled my holy name by their abominations which they have committed wherefore i have consumed them in mine anger now let them put away their harlotry and the carcasses of their kings far from me and i will dwell in the midst of them for ever s thou son of man show the house to the house of israel that they may be ashamed of their iniquities and let them measure accurately and if they be ashamed of all that they have done make known unto them the form of the house and the fashion thereof and the goings out thereof and the

all that i say unto thee concerning all the ordinances of the house of the lord and all the laws thereof and mark well the entering in of the house with every going forth of the sanctuary and thou shalt say to the rebellious even to the house of israel thus saith the lord god o ye house of israel let it suffice you of all your abominations in that ye have brought in aliens uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh to be in my sanctuary to profane it even my house when ye offer my bread the fat and the blood and they have broken my covenant to add unto all your abominations and ye have not kept the charge of my holy things but ye have set keepers of my charge in my sanctuary to please yourselves s thus saith the lord god no alien uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in

things unto the things that are most holy but they shall bear their shame and their abominations which they have committed and i will make them keepers of the charge of the house for all the service thereof and for all that shall be done therein  but the priests the levites the sons of zadok that kept the charge of my sanctuary when the children of israel went astray from me they shall come near

inheritance it shall be for his sons moreover the prince shall not take of the peoples inheritance to thrust them wrongfully out of their possession he shall give inheritance to his sons out of his own possession that my people be not scattered every man from his possession then he brought me through the entry which was at the side of the gate into the holy chambers for the priests which looked toward the north and behold there was a place on the hinder part westward and he said unto me this is the place where the priests shall boil the guiltoffering and the sinoffering where they shall bake the mealoffering that they bring them not forth into the outer court to sanctify the people then he brought me f',\n",
       "  'orth into the outer court and caused me to pass by the four corners of the court and behold in every corner of the court there was a court in the four corners of the court there were courts inclosed forty cubits long and thirty broad these four in the corners were of one measure and there was a row of masonry round about in them round about the four and it was made with boilingplaces under the rows round about then said he unto me these are the boilingplaces where the ministers of the house shall boil the sacrifices of the people and he brought me back unto the door of the house and behold waters issued out from under the threshold of the house eastward for the forefront of the house looked toward the east and the waters came down from under from the right side of the house on the south of the altar then brought he me out by the way of the gate northward and led me round by the way without unto the outer gate by the way of the gate that looketh toward the east and behold there trickled forth waters on the right side when the man went forth eastward with the line in his hand he measured a thousand cubits and he caused me to pass through the waters waters that were to the ankles again he measured a thousand and caused me to pass through the waters waters that were to the knees again he measured a thousand and caused me to pass through waters that were to the loins afterward he measured a thousand and it was a river that i could not pass through for the waters were risen waters to swim in a river that could not be passed through and he said unto me hast thou seen this o son of man then he led me and caused me to return to the bank of the river now when i had been brought back behold upon the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and on the other then said he unto me these waters issue forth toward the eastern region and shall go down into the arabah and when they shall enter into the sea into the sea of the putrid waters the waters shall be healed and it shall come to pass that every living creature wherewith it swarmeth whithersoever the rivers shall come shall live and there shall be a very great multitude of fish for these waters are come thither that all things be healed and may live whithersoever the river cometh and it shall come to pass that fishers shall stand by it from engedi even unto eneglaim there shall be a place for the spreading of nets their fish shall be after their kinds as the fish of the great sea exceeding many but the miry places thereof and the marshes thereof shall not be healed they shall be given for salt and by the river upon the bank thereof on this side and on that side shall grow every tree for food whose leaf shall not wither neither shall the fruit thereof fail it shall bring forth new fruit every month because the waters thereof issue out of the sanctuary and the fruit thereof shall be for food and the leaf thereof for healing  thus saith the lord god this shall be the border whereby ye shall divide the land for inheritance according to the twelve tribes of israel joseph receiving two portions and ye shall inherit it one as well as another concerning which i lifted up my

       " ['\\xa0 now king david was old and stricken in years and they covered him with clothes but he could get no heat\\xa0 wherefore his servants said unto him let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin and let her stand before the king and be a companion unto him and let her lie in thy bosom that my lord the king may get heat\\xa0 so they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the borders of israel and found abishag the shunammite and brought her to the king\\xa0 and the damsel was very fair and she became a companion unto the king and ministered to him but the king knew her not\\xa0 now adonijah the son of haggith exalted himself saying i will be king and he prepared him chariots and horsemen and fifty men to run before him\\xa0 and his father had not grieved him all his life in saying why hast thou done so and he was also a very goodly man and he was born after absalom\\xa0 and he conferred with joab the son of zeruiah and with abiathar the priest and they following adonijah helped him\\xa0 but zadok the priest and benaiah the son of jehoiada and nathan the prophet and shimei and rei and the mighty men that belonged to david were not with adonijah\\xa0 and adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fatlings by the stone of zoheleth which is beside enrogel and he called all his brethren the kings sons and all the men of judah the kings servants\\xa0 but nathan the prophet and benaiah and the mighty men and solomon his brother he called not\\xa0 then nathan spoke unto bathsheba the mother of solomon saying hast thou not heard that adonijah the son of haggith doth reign and david our lord knoweth it not\\xa0 now therefore come let me i pray thee give thee counsel that thou mayest save thine own life and the life of thy son solomon\\xa0 go and get thee in unto king david and say unto him didst not thou my lord o king swear unto thy handmaid saying assuredly solomon thy son shall reign after me and he shall sit upon my throne why then doth adonijah reign\\xa0 behold while thou yet talkest there with the king i also will come in after thee and confirm thy words\\xa0 and bathsheba went in unto the king into the chambernow the king was very old and abishag the shunammite ministered unto the king\\xa0 and bathsheba bowed and prostrated herself unto the king and the king said what wouldest thou\\xa0 and she said unto him my lord thou didst swear by the lord thy god unto thy handmaid assuredly solomon thy son shall reign after me and he shall sit upon my throne\\xa0 and now behold adonijah reigneth and thou my lord the king knowest it not\\xa0 and he hath slain oxen and fatlings and sheep in abundance p\\xa0and hath called all the sons of the king and abiathar the priest and joab the captain of the host but solomon thy servant hath he not called\\xa0 and thou my lord the king the eyes of all israel are upon thee that thou shouldest tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him\\xa0 otherwise it will come to pass when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers that i and my son solomon shall be counted offenders\\xa0 and lo while she yet talked with the king nathan the prophet came in\\xa0 and they told the king saying behold nathan the prophet and when he was come in before the king he bowed down before the king with his face to the ground\\xa0 and nathan said my lord o king hast thou said adonijah shall reign after me and he shall sit upon my throne\\xa0 for he is gone down this day and hath slain oxen and fatlings and sheep in abundance and hath called all the kings sons and the captains of the host and abiathar the priest and behold they eat and drink before him and say long live king adonijah\\xa0 but me even me thy servant and zadok the priest and benaiah the son of jehoiada and thy servant solomon hath he not called\\xa0 is this thing done by my lord the king and thou hast not declared unto thy servant who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him s\\xa0 then king david answered and said call me bathsheba and she came into the kings presence and stood before the king\\xa0 and the king swore and said as the lord liveth who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity\\xa0 verily as i swore unto thee by the lord the god of israel saying assuredly solomon thy son shall reign after me and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead verily so will i do this day\\xa0 then bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth and prostrated herself to the king and said let my lord king david live for ever \\xa0 and king david said call me zadok the priest and nathan the prophet and benaiah the son of jehoiada and they came before the king\\xa0 and the king said unto them take with you the servants of your lord and cause solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule and bring him down to gihon\\xa0 and let zadok the priest and nathan the prophet anoint him there king over israel and blow ye with the horn and say long live king solomon\\xa0 then ye shall come up after him and he shall come and sit upon my throne for he shall be king in my stead and i have appointed him to be prince over israel and over judah\\xa0 and benaiah the son of jehoiada answered the king and said amen so say the lord the god of my lord the king\\xa0 as the lord hath been with my lord the king even so be he with solomon and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king david\\xa0 so zadok the priest and nathan the prophet and benaiah the son of jehoiada and the cherethites and the pelethites went down and caused solomon to ride upon king davids mule and brought him to gihon\\xa0 and zadok the priest took the horn of oil out of the tent and anointed solomon and they blew the rams horn and all the people said long live king solomon\\xa0 and all the people came up after him and the people piped with pipes and rejoiced with great joy so that the earth rent with the sound of them\\xa0 and adonijah and all the guests that were with him heard it as they had made an end of eating and when joab heard the sound of the horn he said wherefore is this noise of the city being in an uproar\\xa0 while he yet spoke behold jonathan the son of abiathar the priest came and adonijah said come in for thou art a worthy man and bringest good tidings\\xa0 and jonathan answered and said to adonijah verily our lord king david hath made solomon king\\xa0 and the king hath sent with him zadok the priest and nathan the prophet and benaiah the son of jehoiada and the cherethites and the pelethites and they have caused him to ride upon the kings mule\\xa0 and zadok the priest and nathan the prophet have anointed him king in gihon and they are come up from thence rejoicing so that the city is in an uproar this is the noise that ye have heard\\xa0 and also solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom\\xa0 and moreover the kings servants came to bless our lord king david saying god make the name of solomon better than thy name and make his throne greater than thy throne and the king bowed down upon the bed\\xa0 and also thus said the king blessed be the lord the god of israel who hath given one to sit on my throne this day mine eyes even seeing it\\xa0 and all the guests of adonijah were afraid and rose up and went every man his way\\xa0 and adonijah feared because of solomon and he arose and went and caught hold on the horns of the altar\\xa0 and it was told solomon saying behold adonijah feareth king solomon for lo he hath laid hold on the horns of the altar saying let king solomon swear unto me first of all that he will not slay his servant with the sword\\xa0 and solomon said if he shall show himself a worthy man there shall not a hair of him fall to the earth but if wickedness be found in him he shall die\\xa0 so king solomon sent and they brought him down from the altar and he came and prostrated himself before king solomon and solomon said unto him go to thy house \\xa0 now the days of david drew nigh that he should die and he charged solomon his son saying\\xa0 i go the way of all the earth be thou strong therefore and show thyself a man\\xa0 and keep the charge of the lord thy god to walk in his ways to keep his statutes and his commandments and his ordinances and his testimonies according to that which is written in the law of moses that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest and whithersoever thou turnest thyself\\xa0 that the lord may establish his word which he spoke concerning me saying if thy children take heed to their way to walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul there shall not fail thee said he a man on the throne of israel\\xa0 moreover thou knowest also what joab the son of zeruiah did unto me even what he did to the two captains of the hosts of israel unto abner the son of ner and unto amasa the son of jether whom he slew and shed the blood of war in peace and put the blood of war upon his girdle that was about his loins and in his shoes that were on his feet\\xa0 do therefore according to thy wisdom and let not his hoar head go down to the grave in peace\\xa0 but show kindness unto the sons of barzillai the gileadite and let them be of those that eat at thy table for so they drew nigh unto me when i fled from absalom thy brother\\xa0 and behold there is with thee shimei the son of gera the benjamite of bahurim who cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when i went to mahanaim but he came down to meet me at the jordan and i swore to him by the lord saying i will not put thee to death with the sword\\xa0 now therefore hold him not guiltless for thou art a wise man and thou wilt know what thou oughtest to do unto him and thou shalt bring his hoar head down to the grave with blood\\xa0 and david slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of david \\xa0 and the days that david reigned over israel were forty years seven years reigned he in hebron and thirty and three years reigned he in jerusalem\\xa0 and solomon sat upon the throne of david his father and his kingdom was established firmly s\\xa0 then adonijah the son of haggith came to bathsheba the mother of solomon and she said comest thou peaceably and he said peaceably\\xa0 he said moreover i have somewhat to say unto thee and she said say on\\xa0 and he said thou knowest that the kingdom was mine and that all israel set their faces on me that i should reign howbeit the kingdom is turned about and is become my brothers for it was his from the lord\\xa0 and now i ask one petition of thee deny me not and she said unto him say on\\xa0 and he said speak i pray thee unto solomon the kingfor he will not say thee naythat he give me abishag the shunammite to wife\\xa0 and bathsheba said well i will speak for thee unto the king\\xa0 bathsheba therefore went unto king solomon to speak unto him for adonijah and the king rose up to meet her and bowed down unto her and sat down on his throne and caused a throne to be set for the kings mother and she sat on his right hand\\xa0 then she said i ask one small petition of thee deny me not and the king said unto her ask on my mother for i will not deny thee\\xa0 and she said let abishag the shunammite be given to adonijah thy brother to wife\\xa0 and king solomon answered and said unto his mother and why dost thou ask abishag the shunammite for adonijah ask for him the kingdom also for he is mine elder brother even for him and for abiathar the priest and for joab the son of zeruiah \\xa0 then king solomon swore by the lord saying god do so to me and more also if adonijah have not spoken this word against his own life\\xa0 now therefore as the lord liveth who hath established me and set me on the throne of david my father and who hath made me a house as he promised surely adonijah shall be put to death this day\\xa0 and king solomon sent by the hand of benaiah the son of jehoiada and he fell upon him so that he died s\\xa0 and unto abiathar the priest said the king get thee to anathoth unto thine own fields for thou art deserving of death but i will not at this time put thee to death because thou didst bear the ark of the lord god before david my father and because thou wast afflicted in all wherein my father was afflicted\\xa0 so solomon thrust out abiathar from being priest unto the lord that the word of the lord might be fulfilled which he spoke concerning the house of eli in shiloh \\xa0 and the tidings came to joab for joab had turned after adonijah though he turned not after absalom and joab fled unto the tent of the lo',\n",
       "  'rd and caught hold on the horns of the altar\\xa0 and it was told king solomon joab is fled unto the tent of the lord and behold he is by the altar then solomon sent benaiah the son of jehoiada saying go fall upon him\\xa0 and benaiah came to the tent of the lord and said unto him thus saith the king come forth and he said nay but i will die here and benaiah brought back word unto the king saying thus said joab and thus he answered me\\xa0 and the king said unto him do as he hath said and fall upon him and bury him that thou mayest take away the blood which joab shed without cause from me and from my fathers house\\xa0 and the lord will return his blood upon his own head because he fell upon two men more righteous and better than he and slew them with the sword and my father david knew it not abner the son of ner captain of the host of israel and amasa the son of jether captain of the host of judah\\xa0 so shall their blood return upon the head of joab and upon the head of his seed for ever but unto david and unto his seed and unto his house and unto his throne shall there be peace for ever from the lord\\xa0 then benaiah the son of jehoiada went up and fell upon him and slew him and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness\\xa0 and the king put benaiah the son of jehoiada in his room over the host and zadok the priest did the king put in the room of abiathar\\xa0 and the king sent and called for shimei and said unto him build thee a house in jerusalem and dwell there and go not forth thence any whither\\xa0 for on the day thou goest out and passest over the brook kidron know thou for certain that thou shalt surely die thy blood shall be upon thine own head\\xa0 and shimei said unto the king the saying is good as my lord the king hath said so will thy servant do and shimei dwelt in jerusalem many days s\\xa0 and it came to pass at the end of three years that two of the servants of shimei ran away unto achish son of maacah king of gath and they told shimei saying behold thy servants are in gath\\xa0 and shimei arose and saddled his ass and went to gath to achish to seek his servants and shimei went and brought his servants from gath s\\xa0 and it was told solomon that shimei had gone from jerusalem to gath and was come back\\xa0 and the king sent and called for shimei and said unto him did i not make thee to swear by the lord and forewarned thee saying know for certain that on the day thou goest out and walkest abroad any whither thou shalt surely die and thou saidst unto me the saying is good i have heard it\\xa0 why then hast thou not kept the oath of the lord and the commandment that i have charged thee with\\xa0 the king said moreover to shimei thou knowest all the wickedness which thy heart is privy to that thou didst to david my father therefore the lord shall return thy wickedness upon thine own head\\xa0 but king solomon shall be blessed and the throne of david shall be established before the lord for ever\\xa0 so the king commanded benaiah the son of jehoiada and he went out and fell upon him so that he died and the kingdom was established in the hand of solomon\\xa0 and solomon became allied to pharaoh king of egypt by marriage and took pharaohs daughter and brought her into the city of david until he had made an end of building his own house and the house of the lord and the wall of jerusalem round about\\xa0 only the people sacrificed in the high places because there was no house built for the name of the lord until those days \\xa0 and solomon loved the lord walking in the statutes of david his father only he sacrificed and offered in the high places\\xa0 and the king went to gibeon to sacrifice there for that was the great high place a thousand burntofferings did solomon offer upon that altar\\xa0 in gibeon the lord appeared to solomon in a dream by night and god said ask what i shall give thee\\xa0 and solomon said thou hast shown unto thy servant david my father great kindness according as he walked before thee in truth and in righteousness and in uprightness of heart with thee and thou hast kept for him this great kindness that thou hast given him a son to sit on his throne as it is this day\\xa0 and now o lord my god thou hast made thy servant king instead of david my father and i am but a little child i know not how to go out or come in\\xa0 and thy servant is in the midst of thy people which thou hast chosen a great people that cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude\\xa0 give thy servant therefore an understanding heart to judge thy people that i may discern between good and evil for who is able to judge this thy great people\\xa0 and the speech pleased the lord that solomon had asked this thing\\xa0 and god said unto him because thou hast asked this thing and hast not asked for thyself long life neither hast asked riches for thyself nor hast asked the life of thine enemies but hast asked for thyself understanding to discern justice\\xa0 behold i have done according to thy word lo i have given thee a wise and an understanding heart so that there hath been none like thee before thee neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee\\xa0 and i have also given thee that which thou hast not asked both riches and honourso that there hath not been any among the kings like unto theeall thy days\\xa0 and if thou wilt walk in my ways to keep my statutes and my commandments as thy father david did walk then i will lengthen thy days s\\xa0 and solomon awoke and behold it was a dream and he came to jerusalem and stood before the ark of the covenant of the lord and offered up burntofferings and offered peaceofferings and made a feast to all his servants \\xa0 then came there two women that were harlots unto the king and stood before him\\xa0 and the one woman said oh my lord i and this woman dwell in one house and i was delivered of a child with her in the house\\xa0 and it came to pass the third day after i was delivered that this woman was delivered also and we were together there was no stranger with us in the house save we two in the house\\xa0 and this womans child died in the night because she overlay it\\xa0 and she arose at midnight and took my son from beside me while thy handmaid slept and laid it in her bosom and laid her dead child in my bosom\\xa0 and when i rose in the morning to give my child suck behold it was dead but when i had looked well at it in the morning behold it was not my son whom i did bear\\xa0 and the other woman said nay but the living is my son and the dead is thy son and this said no but the dead is thy son and the living is my son thus they spoke before the king\\xa0 then said the king the one saith this is my son that liveth and thy son is the dead and the other saith nay but thy son is the dead and my son is the living \\xa0 and the king said fetch me a sword and they brought a sword before the king\\xa0 and the king said divide the living child in two and give half to the one and half to the other\\xa0 then spoke the woman whose the living child was unto the king for her heart yearned upon her son and she said oh my lord give her the living child and in no wise slay it but the other said it shall be neither mine nor thine divide it\\xa0 then the king answered and said give her the living child and in no wise slay it she is the mother thereof s\\xa0 and all israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged and they feared the king for they saw that the wisdom of god was in him to do justice s\\xa0 and king solomon was king over all israel s\\xa0 and these were the princes whom he had azariah the son of zadok the priest s\\xa0 elihoreph and ahijah the sons of shisha scribes s jehoshaphat the son of ahilud the recorder s\\xa0 and benaiah the son of jehoiada was over the host s and zadok and abiathar were priests s\\xa0 and azariah the son of nathan was over the officers s and zabud the son of nathan was chief minister and the kings friend s\\xa0 and ahishar was over the household s and adoniram the son of abda was over the levy s\\xa0 and solomon had twelve officers over all israel who provided victuals for the king and his household each man had to make provision for a month in the year s\\xa0 and these are their names the son of hur in the hillcountry of ephraim s\\xa0 the son of deker in makaz and in shaalbim and bethshemesh and elonbethhanan s\\xa0 the son of hesed in arubboth to him pertained socoh and all the land of hepher s\\xa0 the son of abinadab in all the region of dor he had taphath the daughter of solomon to wife s\\xa0 baana the son of ahilud in taanach and megiddo and all bethshean which is beside zarethan beneath jezreel from bethshean to abelmeholah as far as beyond jokmeam s\\xa0 the son of geber in ramothgilead to him pertained the villages of jair the son of manasseh which are in gilead even to him pertained the region of argob which is in bashan threescore great cities with walls and brazen bars s\\xa0 ahinadab the son of iddo in mahanaim s\\xa0 ahimaaz in naphtali he also took basemath the daughter of solomon to wife s\\xa0 baana the son of hushai in asher and bealoth s\\xa0 jehoshaphat the son of paruah in issachar s\\xa0 shimei the son of ela in benjamin s\\xa0 geber the son of uri in the land of gilead the country of sihon king of the amorites and of og king of bashan and one officer that was  in the land\\xa0 judah and israel were many as the sand which is by the sea in multitude eating and drinking and making merry\\xa0 and solomon ruled over all the kingdoms from the river unto the land of the philistines and unto the border of egypt they brought presents and served solomon all the days of his life \\xa0 and solomons provision for one day was thirty measures of fine flour and threescore measures of meal\\xa0 ten fat oxen and twenty oxen out of the pastures and a hundred sheep beside harts and gazelles and roebucks and fatted fowl\\xa0 for he had dominion over all the region on this side the river from tiphsah even to gaza over all the kings on this side the river and he had peace on all sides round about him\\xa0 and judah and israel dwelt safely every man under his vine and under his figtree from dan even to beersheba all the days of solomon s\\xa0 and solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots and twelve thousand horsemen\\xa0 and those officers provided victual for king solomon and for all that came unto king solomons table every man in his month they let nothing be lacking\\xa0 barley also and straw for the horses and swift steeds brought they unto the place where it should be every man according to his charge s\\xa0 and god gave solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much and largeness of heart even as the sand that is on the seashore\\xa0 and solomons wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east and all the wisdom of egypt\\xa0 for he was wiser than all men than ethan the ezrahite and heman and calcol and darda the sons of mahol and his fame was in all the nations round about\\xa0 and he spoke three thousand proverbs and his songs were a thousand and five\\xa0 and he spoke of trees from the cedar that is in lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall he spoke also of beasts and of fowl and of creeping things and of fishes\\xa0 and there came of all peoples to hear the wisdom of solomon from all kings of the earth who had heard of his wisdom s\\xa0 and hiram king of tyre sent his servants unto solomon for he had heard that they had anointed him king in the room of his father for hiram was ever a lover of david s\\xa0 and solomon sent to hiram saying\\xa0 thou knowest how that david my father could not build a house for the name of the lord his god for the wars which were about him on every side until the lord put them under the soles of my feet\\xa0 but now the lord my god hath given me rest on every side there is neither adversary nor evil occurrence\\xa0 and behold i purpose to build a house for the name of the lord my god as the lord spoke unto david my father saying thy son whom i will set upon thy throne in thy room he shall build the house for my name\\xa0 now therefore command thou that they hew me cedartrees out of lebanon and my servants shall be with thy servants and i will give thee hire for thy servants according to all that thou shalt say for thou knowest that there is not among us any that hath skill to hew timber like unto the zidonians\\xa0 and it came to pass when hiram heard the word',\n",
       "  's of solomon that he rejoiced greatly and said blessed be the lord this day who hath given unto david a wise son over this great people\\xa0 and hiram sent to solomon saying i have heard that which thou hast sent unto me i will do all thy desire concerning timber of cedar and concerning timber of cypress\\xa0 my servants shall bring them down from lebanon unto the sea and i will make them into rafts to go by sea unto the place that thou shalt appoint me and will cause them to be broken up there and thou shalt receive them and thou shalt accomplish my desire in giving food for my household\\xa0 so hiram gave solomon timber of cedar and timber of cypress according to all his desire\\xa0 and solomon gave hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for food to his household and twenty measures of beaten oil thus gave solomon to hiram year by year \\xa0 and the lord gave solomon wisdom as he promised him and there was peace between hiram and solomon and they two made a league together\\xa0 and king solomon raised a levy out of all israel and the levy was thirty thousand men\\xa0 and he sent them to lebanon ten thousand a month by courses a month they were in lebanon and two months at home and adoniram was over the levy s\\xa0 and solomon had threescore and ten thousand that bore burdens and fourscore thousand that were hewers in the mountains\\xa0 besides solomons chief officers that were over the work three thousand and three hundred who bore rule over the people that wrought in the work s\\xa0 and the king commanded and they quarried great stones costly stones to lay the foundation of the house with hewn stone\\xa0 and solomons builders and hirams builders and the gebalites did fashion them and prepared the timber and the stones to build the house \\xa0 and it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of israel were come out of the land of egypt in the fourth year of solomons reign over israel in the month ziv which is the second month that he began to build the house of the lord\\xa0 and the house which king solomon built for the lord the length thereof was threescore cubits and the breadth thereof twenty cubits and the height thereof thirty cubits\\xa0 and the porch before the temple of the house twenty cubits was the length thereof according to the breadth of the house and ten cubits was the breadth thereof before the house\\xa0 and for the house he made windows broad within and narrow without\\xa0 and against the wall of the house he built a sidestructure round about against the walls of the house round about both of the temple and of the sanctuary and he made sidechambers round about\\xa0 the nethermost story of the sidestructure was five cubits broad and the middle was six cubits broad and the third was seven cubits broad for on the outside he made rebatements in the wall of the house round about that the beams should not have hold in the walls of the house\\xa0 for the house when it was in building was built of stone made ready at the quarry and there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house while it was in building\\xa0 the door for the lowest row of chambers was in the right side of the house and they went up by winding stairs into the middle row and out of the middle into the third\\xa0 so he built the house and finished it and he covered in the house with planks of cedar over beams\\xa0 and he built the stories of the sidestructure against all the house each five cubits high and they rested on the house with timber of cedar \\xa0 and the word of the lord came to solomon saying\\xa0 as for this house which thou art building if thou wilt walk in my statutes and execute mine ordinances and keep all my commandments to walk in them then will i establish my word with thee which i spoke unto david thy father\\xa0 in that i will dwell therein among the children of israel and will not forsake my people israel \\xa0 so solomon built the house and finished it\\xa0 and he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar from the floor of the house unto the joists of the ceiling he covered them on the inside with wood and he covered the floor of the house with boards of cypress\\xa0 and he built twenty cubits on the hinder part of the house with boards of cedar from the floor unto the joists he even built them for himself within for a sanctuary even for the most holy place\\xa0 and the house that is the temple before  was forty cubits long\\xa0 and the cedar on the house within was carved with knops and open flowers all was cedar there was no stone seen\\xa0 and he prepared the sanctuary in the midst of the house within to set there the ark of the covenant of the lord\\xa0 and before the sanctuary which was twenty cubits in length and twenty cubits in breadth and twenty cubits in the height thereof overlaid with pure gold he set an altar which he covered with cedar\\xa0 so solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold and he drew chains of gold across the wall before the sanctuary and he overlaid it with gold\\xa0 and the whole house he overlaid with gold until all the house was finished also the whole altar that belonged to the sanctuary he overlaid with gold\\xa0 and in the sanctuary he made two cherubim of olivewood each ten cubits high\\xa0 and five cubits was the one wing of the cherub and five cubits the other wing of the cherub from the uttermost part of the one wing unto the uttermost part of the other were ten cubits\\xa0 and the other cherub was ten cubits both the cherubim were of one measure and one form\\xa0 the height of the one cherub was ten cubits and so was it of the other cherub\\xa0 and he set the cherubim within the inner house and the wings of the cherubim were stretched forth so that the wing of the one touched the one wall and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall and their wings touched one another in the midst of the house\\xa0 and he overlaid the cherubim with gold\\xa0 and he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures of cherubim and palmtrees and open flowers within and without\\xa0 and the floor of the house he overlaid with gold within and without\\xa0 and for the entrance of the sanctuary he made doors of olivewood the doorposts within the frame having five angles\\xa0 and as for the two doors of olivewood he carved upon them carvings of cherubim and palmtrees and open flowers and overlaid them with gold and he spread the gold upon the cherubim and upon the palmtrees\\xa0 so also made he for the entrance of the temple doorposts of olivewood within a frame foursquare\\xa0 and two doors of cypresswood the two leaves of the one door were folding and the two leaves of the other door were folding\\xa0 and he carved thereon cherubim and palmtrees and open flowers and he overlaid them with gold fitted upon the graven work\\xa0 and he built the inner court with three rows of hewn stone and a row of cedar beams\\xa0 in the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the lord laid in the month ziv\\xa0 and in the eleventh year in the month bul which is the eighth month was the house finished throughout all the parts thereof and according to all the fashion of it so was he seven years in building it\\xa0 and solomon was building his own house thirteen years and he finished all his house\\xa0 for he built the house of the forest of lebanon the length thereof was a hundred cubits and the breadth thereof fifty cubits and the height thereof thirty cubits upon four rows of cedar pillars with cedar beams upon the pillars\\xa0 and it was covered with cedar above upon the sidechambers that lay on forty and five pillars fifteen in a row\\xa0 and there were beams in three rows and light was over against light in three ranks\\xa0 and all the doors with their posts were square in the frame and light was over against light in three ranks\\xa0 and he made the porch of pillars the length thereof was fifty cubits and the breadth thereof thirty cubits and a porch before them and pillars and thick beams before them\\xa0 and he made the porch of the throne where he might judge even the porch of judgment and it was covered with cedar from floor to floor\\xa0 and his house where he might dwell in the other court within the porch was of the like work he made also a house for pharaohs daughter whom solomon had taken to wife like unto this porch\\xa0 all these were of costly stones according to the measures of hewn stones sawed with saws within and without even from the foundation unto the coping and so on the outside unto the great court\\xa0 and the foundation was of costly stones even great stones stones of ten cubits and stones of eight cubits\\xa0 and above were costly stones after the measure of hewn stones and cedarwood\\xa0 and the great court round about had three rows of hewn stone and a row of cedar beams like as the inner court of the house of the lord and the court of the porch of the house \\xa0 and king solomon sent and fetched hiram out of tyre\\xa0 he was the son of a widow of the tribe of naphtali and his father was a man of tyre a worker in brass and he was filled with wisdom and understanding and skill to work all works in brass and he came to king solomon and wrought all his work\\xa0 thus he fashioned the two pillars of brass of eighteen cubits high each and a line of twelve cubits did compass it about  the other pillar\\xa0 and he made two capitals of molten brass to set upon the tops of the pillars the height of the one capital was five cubits and the height of the other capital was five cubits\\xa0 he also made nets of checkerwork and wreaths of chainwork for the capitals which were upon the top of the pillars seven for the one capital and seven for the other capital\\xa0 and he made the pillars and there were two rows round about upon the one network to cover the capitals that were upon the top of the pomegranates and so did he for the other capital\\xa0 and the capitals that were upon the top of the pillars in the porch were of lilywork four cubits\\xa0 and there were capitals above also upon the two pillars close by the belly which was beside the network and the pomegranates were two hundred in rows round about upon each capital\\xa0 and he set up the pillars at the porch of the temple and he set up the right pillar and called the name thereof jachin and he set up the left pillar and called the name thereof boaz\\xa0 and upon the top of the pillars was lilywork so was the work of the pillars finished\\xa0 and he made the molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim round in compass and the height thereof was five cubits and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about\\xa0 and under the brim of it round about there were knops which did compass it for ten cubits compassing the sea round about the knops were in two rows cast when it was cast\\xa0 it stood upon twelve oxen three looking toward the north and three looking toward the west and three looking toward the south and three looking toward the east and the sea was set upon them above and all their hinder parts were inward\\xa0 and it was a handbreadth thick and the brim thereof was wrought like the brim of a cup like the flower of a lily it held two thousand baths \\xa0 and he made the ten bases of brass four cubits was the length of one base and four cubits the breadth thereof and three cubits the height of it\\xa0 and the work of the bases was on this manner they had borders and there were borders between the stays\\xa0 and on the borders that were between the stays were lions oxen and cherubim and upon the stays it was in like manner above and beneath the lions and oxen were wreaths of hanging work\\xa0 and every base had four brazen wheels and axles of brass and the four feet thereof had undersetters beneath the laver were the undersetters molten with wreaths at the side of each\\xa0 and the mouth of it within the crown and above was a cubit high and the mouth thereof was round after the work of a pedestal a cubit and a half and also upon the mouth of it were gravings and their borders were foursquare not round\\xa0 and the four wheels were underneath the borders and the axletrees of the wheels were in the base and the height of a wheel was a cubit and half a cubit\\xa0 and the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel their axletrees and their felloes and their spokes and their naves were all molten\\xa0 and there were four underset',\n",
       "  'ters at the four corners of each base the undersetters thereof were of one piece with the base itself\\xa0 and in the top of the base was there a round compass of half a cubit high and on the top of the base the stays thereof and the borders thereof were of one piece therewith\\xa0 and on the plates of the stays thereof and on the borders thereof he graved cherubim lions and palmtrees according to the space of each with wreaths round about\\xa0 after this manner he made the ten bases all of them had one casting one measure and one form s\\xa0 and he made ten lavers of brass one laver contained forty baths and every laver was four cubits and upon every one of the ten bases one laver\\xa0 and he set the bases five on the right side of the house and five on the left side of the house and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward toward the south s\\xa0 and hiram made the pots and the shovels and the basins so hiram made an end of doing all the work that he wrought for king solomon in the house of the lord\\xa0 the two pillars and the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars and the two networks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars\\xa0 and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks two rows of pomegranates for each network to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were upon the top of the pillars\\xa0 and the ten bases and the ten lavers on the bases\\xa0 and the one sea and the twelve oxen under the sea\\xa0 and the pots and the shovels and the basins even all these vessels which hiram made for king solomon in the house of the lord were of burnished brass\\xa0 in the plain of the jordan did the king cast them in the clay ground between succoth and zarethan\\xa0 and solomon left all the vessels unweighed because they were exceeding many the weight of the brass could not be found out\\xa0 and solomon made all the vessels that were in the house of the lord the golden altar and the table whereupon the showbread was of gold\\xa0 and the candlesticks five on the right side and five on the left before the sanctuary of pure gold and the flowers and the lamps and the tongs of gold\\xa0 and the cups and the snuffers and the basins and the pans and the firepans of pure gold and the hinges both for the doors of the inner house the most holy place and for the doors of the house that is of the temple of gold \\xa0 thus all the work that king solomon wrought in the house of the lord was finished and solomon brought in the things which david his father had dedicated the silver and the gold and the vessels and put them in the treasuries of the house of the lord \\xa0 then solomon assembled the elders of israel and all the heads of the tribes the princes of the fathers houses of the children of israel unto king solomon in jerusalem to bring up the ark of the covenant of the lord out of the city of david which is zion\\xa0 and all the men of israel assembled themselves unto king solomon at the feast in the month ethanim which is the seventh month\\xa0 and all the elders of israel came and the priests took up the ark\\xa0 and they brought up the ark of the lord and the tent of meeting and all the holy vessels that were in the tent even these did the priests and the levites bring up\\xa0 and king solomon and all the congregation of israel that were assembled unto him were with him before the ark sacrificing sheep and oxen that could not be told nor numbered for multitude\\xa0 and the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the lord unto its place into the sanctuary of the house to the most holy place even under the wings of the cherubim\\xa0 for the cherubim spread forth their wings over the place of the ark and the cherubim covered the ark and the staves thereof above\\xa0 and the staves were so long that the ends of the staves were seen from the holy place even before the sanctuary but they could not be seen without and there they are unto this day\\xa0 there was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone which moses put there at horeb when the lord made a covenant with the children of israel when they came out of the land of egypt\\xa0 and it came to pass when the priests were come out of the holy place that the cloud filled the house of the lord\\xa0 so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud for the glory of the lord filled the house of the lord \\xa0 then spoke solomon the lord hath said that he would dwell in the thick darkness\\xa0 i have surely built thee a house of habitation a place for thee to dwell in for ever\\xa0 and the king turned his face about and blessed all the congregation of israel and all the congregation of israel stood\\xa0 and he said blessed be the lord the god of israel who spoke with his mouth unto david my father and hath with his hand fulfilled it saying\\xa0 since the day that i brought forth my people israel out of egypt i chose no city out of all the tribes of israel to build a house that my name might be there but i chose david to be over my people israel\\xa0 now it was in the heart of david my father to build a house for the name of the lord the god of israel\\xa0 but the lord said unto david my father whereas it was in thy heart to build a house for my name thou didst well that it was in thy heart\\xa0 nevertheless thou shalt not build the house but thy son that shall come forth out of thy loins he shall build the house for my name\\xa0 and the lord hath established his word that he spoke for i am risen up in the room of david my father and sit on the throne of israel as the lord promised and have built the house for the name of the lord the god of israel\\xa0 and there have i set a place for the ark wherein is the covenant of the lord which he made with our fathers when he brought them out of the land of egypt s\\xa0 and solomon stood before the altar of the lord in the presence of all the congregation of israel and spread forth his hands toward heaven\\xa0 and he said o lord the god of israel there is no god like thee in heaven above or on earth beneath who keepest covenant and mercy with thy servants that walk before thee with all their heart\\xa0 who hast kept with thy servant david my father that which thou didst promise him yea thou spokest with thy mouth and hast fulfilled it with thy hand as it is this day\\xa0 now therefore o lord the god of israel keep with thy servant david my father that which thou hast promised him saying there shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit on the throne of israel if only thy children take heed to their way to walk before me as thou hast walked before me\\xa0 now therefore o god of israel let thy word i pray thee be verified which thou didst speak unto thy servant david my father\\xa0 but will god in very truth dwell on the earth behold heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee how much less this house that i have builded\\xa0 yet have thou respect unto the prayer of thy servant and to his supplication o lord my god to hearken unto the cry and to the prayer which thy servant prayeth before thee this day\\xa0 that thine eyes may be open toward this house night and day even toward the place whereof thou hast said my name shall be there to hearken unto the prayer which thy servant shall pray toward this place\\xa0 and hearken thou to the supplication of thy servant and of thy people israel when they shall pray toward this place yea hear thou in heaven thy dwellingplace and when thou hearest forgive\\xa0 if a man sin against his neighbour and an oath be exacted of him to cause him to swear and he come and swear before thine altar in this house\\xa0 then hear thou in heaven and do and judge thy servants condemning the wicked to bring his way upon his own head and justifying the righteous to give him according to his righteousness\\xa0 when thy people israel are smitten down before the enemy when they do sin against thee if they turn again to thee and confess thy name and pray and make supplication unto thee in this house\\xa0 then hear thou in heaven and forgive the sin of thy people israel and bring them back unto the land which thou gavest unto their fathers s\\xa0 when heaven is shut up and there is no rain when they do sin against thee if they pray toward this place and confess thy name and turn from their sin when thou dost afflict them\\xa0 then hear thou in heaven and forgive the sin of thy servants and of thy people israel when thou teachest them the good way wherein they should walk and send rain upon thy land which thou hast given to thy people for an inheritance s\\xa0 if there be in the land famine if there be pestilence if there be blasting or mildew locust or caterpillar if their enemy besiege them in the land of their cities whatsoever plague whatsoever sickness there be\\xa0 what prayer and supplication soever be made by any man of all thy people israel who shall know every man the plague of his own heart and spread forth his hands toward this house\\xa0 then hear thou in heaven thy dwellingplace and forgive and do and render unto every man according to all his ways whose heart thou knowestfor thou even thou only knowest the hearts of all the children of men\\xa0 that they may fear thee all the days that they live in the land which thou gavest unto our fathers\\xa0 moreover concerning the stranger that is not of thy people israel when he shall come out of a far country for thy names sake\\xa0 for they shall hear of thy great name and of thy mighty hand and of thine outstretched armwhen he shall come and pray toward this house\\xa0 hear thou in heaven thy dwellingplace and do according to all that the stranger calleth to thee for that all the peoples of the earth may know thy name to fear thee as doth thy people israel and that they may know that thy name is called upon this house which i have built\\xa0 if thy people go out to battle against their enemy by whatsoever way thou shalt send them and they pray unto the lord toward the city which thou hast chosen and toward the house which i have built for thy name\\xa0 then hear thou in heaven their prayer and their supplication and maintain their cause\\xa0 if they sin against theefor there is no man that sinneth notand thou be angry with them and deliver them to the enemy so that they carry them away captive unto the land of the enemy far off or near\\xa0 yet if they shall bethink themselves in the land whither they are carried captive and turn back and make supplication unto thee in the land of them that carried them captive saying we have sinned and have done iniquitously we have dealt wickedly\\xa0 if they return unto thee with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their enemies who carried them captive and pray unto thee toward their land which thou gavest unto their fathers the city which thou hast chosen and the house which i have built for thy name\\xa0 then hear thou their prayer and their supplication in heaven thy dwellingplace and maintain their cause\\xa0 and forgive thy people who have sinned against thee and all their transgressions wherein they have transgressed against thee and give them compassion before those who carried them captive that they may have compassion on them\\xa0 for they are thy people and thine inheritance which thou broughtest forth out of egypt from the midst of the furnace of iron\\xa0 that thine eyes may be open unto the supplication of thy servant and unto the supplication of thy people israel to hearken unto them whensoever they cry unto thee\\xa0 for thou didst set them apart from among all the peoples of the earth to be thine inheritance as thou didst speak by the hand of moses thy servant when thou broughtest our fathers out of egypt o lord god \\xa0 and it was so that when solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication unto the lord he arose from before the altar of the lord from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread forth toward heaven\\xa0 and he stood and blessed all the congregation of israel with a loud voice saying\\xa0 blessed be the lord that hath given rest unto his people israel according to all that he promised there hath not failed one word of all his good promise which he promised by the hand of moses his servant\\xa0 the lord our god be with us as he was with our fathers let him not leave us nor forsake us\\xa0 that he may incline our hearts unto him',\n",
       "  ' to walk in all his ways and to keep his commandments and his statutes and his ordinances which he commanded our fathers\\xa0 and let these my words wherewith i have made supplication before the lord be nigh unto the lord our god day and night that he maintain the cause of his servant and the cause of his people israel as every day shall require\\xa0 that all the peoples of the earth may know that the lord he is god there is none else\\xa0 let your heart therefore be whole with the lord our god to walk in his statutes and to keep his commandments as at this day\\xa0 and the king and all israel with him offered sacrifice before the lord\\xa0 and solomon offered for the sacrifice of peaceofferings which he offered unto the lord two and twenty thousand oxen and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep so the king and all the children of israel dedicated the house of the lord\\xa0 the same day did the king hallow the middle of the court that was before the house of the lord for there he offered the burntoffering and the mealoffering and the fat of the peaceofferings because the brazen altar that was before the lord was too little to receive the burntoffering and the mealoffering and the fat of the peaceofferings\\xa0 so solomon held the feast at that time and all israel with him a great congregation from the entrance hamath unto the brook of egypt before the lord our god seven days and seven days even fourteen days\\xa0 on the eighth day he sent the people away and they blessed the king and went unto their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that the lord had shown unto david his servant and to israel his people\\xa0 and it came to pass when solomon had finished the building of the house of the lord and the kings house and all solomons delight which he was pleased to do \\xa0 that the lord appeared to solomon the second time as he had appeared unto him at gibeon\\xa0 and the lord said unto him i have heard thy prayer and thy supplication that thou hast made before me i have hallowed this house which thou hast built to put my name there for ever and mine eyes and my heart shall be there perpetually\\xa0 and as for thee if thou wilt walk before me as david thy father walked in integrity of heart and in uprightness to do according to all that i have commanded thee and wilt keep my statutes and mine ordinances\\xa0 then i will establish the throne of thy kingdom over israel for ever according as i promised to david thy father saying there shall not fail thee a man upon the throne of israel\\xa0 but if ye shall turn away from following me ye or your children and not keep my commandments and my statutes which i have set before you but shall go and serve other gods and worship them\\xa0 then will i cut off israel out of the land which i have given them and this house which i have hallowed for my name will i cast out of my sight and israel shall be a proverb and a by word among all peoples\\xa0 and this house which is so high  and every one that passeth by it shall be astonished and shall hiss and when they shall say why hath the lord done thus unto this land and to this house\\xa0 they shall be answered because they forsook the lord their god who brought forth their fathers out of the land of egypt and laid hold on other gods and worshipped them and served them therefore hath the lord brought all this evil upon them \\xa0 and it came to pass at the end of twenty years wherein solomon had built the two houses the house of the lord and the kings house\\xa0 now hiram the king of tyre had furnished solomon with cedartrees and cypresstrees and with gold according to all his desirethat then king solomon gave hiram twenty cities in the land of galilee\\xa0 and hiram came out from tyre to see the cities which solomon had given him and they pleased him not\\xa0 and he said what cities are these which thou hast given me my brother and they were called the land of cabul unto this day \\xa0 and hiram sent to the king sixscore talents of gold\\xa0 and this is the account of the levy which king solomon raised to build the house of the lord and his own house and millo and the wall of jerusalem and hazor and megiddo and gezer\\xa0 pharaoh king of egypt had gone up and taken gezer and burnt it with fire and slain the canaanites that dwelt in the city and given it for a portion unto his daughter solomons wife\\xa0 and solomon built gezer and bethhoron the nether\\xa0 and baalath and tadmor in the wilderness in the land\\xa0 and all the storecities that solomon had and the cities for his chariots and the cities for his horsemen and that which solomon desired to build for his pleasure in jerusalem and in lebanon and in all the land of his dominion\\xa0 all the people that were left of the amorites the hittites the perizzites the hivites and the jebusites who were not of the children of israel\\xa0 even their children that were left after them in the land whom the children of israel were not able utterly to destroy of them did solomon raise a levy of bondservants unto this day\\xa0 but of the children of israel did solomon make no bondservants but they were the men of war and his servants and his princes and his captains and rulers of his chariots and of his horsemen s\\xa0 these were the chief officers that were over solomons work five hundred and fifty who bore rule over the people that wrought in the work\\xa0 but pharaohs daughter came up out of the city of david unto her house which  had built for her then did he build millo\\xa0 and three times in a year did solomon offer burntofferings and peaceofferings upon the altar which he built unto the lord offering thereby upon the altar that was before the lord so he finished the house\\xa0 and king solomon made a navy of ships in eziongeber which is beside eloth on the shore of the red sea in the land of edom\\xa0 and hiram sent in the navy his servants shipmen that had knowledge of the sea with the servants of solomon\\xa0 and they came to ophir and fetched from thence gold four hundred and twenty talents and brought it to king solomon \\xa0 and when the queen of sheba heard of the fame of solomon because of the name of the lord she came to prove him with hard questions\\xa0 and she came to jerusalem with a very great train with camels that bore spices and gold very much and precious stones and when she was come to solomon she spoke with him of all that was in her heart\\xa0 and solomon told her all her questions there was not any thing hid from the king which he told her not\\xa0 and when the queen of sheba had seen all the wisdom of solomon and the house that he had built\\xa0 and the food of his table and the sitting of his servants and the attendance of his ministers and their apparel and his cupbearers and his burntoffering which he offered in the house of the lord there was no more spirit in her\\xa0 and she said to the king it was a true report that i heard in mine own land of thine acts and of thy wisdom\\xa0 howbeit i believed not the words until i came and mine eyes had seen it and behold the half was not told me thou hast wisdom and prosperity exceeding the fame which i heard\\xa0 happy are thy men happy are these thy servants that stand continually before thee and that hear thy wisdom\\xa0 blessed be the lord thy god who delighted in thee to set thee on the throne of israel because the lord loved israel for ever therefore made he thee king to do justice and righteousness\\xa0 and she gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold and of spices very great store and precious stones there came no more such abundance of spices as these which the queen of sheba gave to king solomon\\xa0 and the navy also of hiram that brought gold from ophir brought in from ophir great plenty of sandalwood and precious stones\\xa0 and the king made of the sandalwood pillars for the house of the lord and for the kings house harps also and psalteries for the singers there came no such sandalwood nor was seen unto this day\\xa0 and king solomon gave to the queen of sheba all her desire whatsoever she asked beside that which solomon gave her of his royal bounty so she turned and went to her own land she and her servants \\xa0 now the weight of gold that came to solomon in one year was six hundred threescore and six talents of gold\\xa0 beside that which came of the merchants and of the traffic of the traders and of all the kings of the mingled people and of the governors of the country\\xa0 and king solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold six hundred shekels of gold went to one target\\xa0 and he made three hundred shields of beaten gold three pounds of gold went to one shield and the king put them in the house of the forest of lebanon \\xa0 moreover the king made a great throne of ivory and overlaid it with the finest gold\\xa0 there were six steps to the throne and the top of the throne was round behind and there were arms on either side by the place of the seat and two lions standing beside the arms\\xa0 and twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps there was not the like made in any kingdom\\xa0 and all king solomons drinkingvessels were of gold and all the vessels of the house of the forest of lebanon were of pure gold none were of silver it was nothing accounted of in the days of solomon\\xa0 for the king had at sea a navy of tarshish with the navy of hiram once every three years came the navy of tarshish bringing gold and silver ivory and apes and peacocks\\xa0 so king solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth in riches and in wisdom\\xa0 and all the earth sought the presence of solomon to hear his wisdom which god had put in his heart\\xa0 and they brought every man his present vessels of silver and vessels of gold and raiment and armour and spices horses and mules a rate year by year s\\xa0 and solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots and twelve thousand horsemen that he bestowed in the chariot cities and with the king at jerusalem\\xa0 and the king made silver to be in jerusalem as stones and cedars made he to be as the sycamoretrees that are in the lowland for abundance\\xa0 and the horses which solomon had were brought out of egypt also out of keveh the kings merchants buying them of the men of keveh at a price\\xa0 and a chariot came up and went out of egypt for six hundred shekels of silver and a horse for a hundred and fifty and so for all the kings of the hittites and for the kings of aram did they bring them out by their means \\xa0 now king solomon loved many foreign women besides the daughter of pharaoh women of the moabites ammonites edomites zidonians and hittites\\xa0 of the nations concerning which the lord said unto the children of israel ye shall not go among them neither shall they come among you for surely they will turn away your heart after their gods solomon did cleave unto these in love\\xa0 and he had seven hundred wives princesses and three hundred concubines and his wives turned away his heart\\xa0 for it came to pass when solomon was old that his wives turned away his heart after other gods and his heart was not whole with the lord his god as was the heart of david his father\\xa0 for solomon went after ashtoreth the goddess of the zidonians and after milcom the detestation of the ammonites\\xa0 and solomon did that which was evil in the sight of the lord and went not fully after the lord as did david his father s\\xa0 then did solomon build a high place for chemosh the detestation of moab in the mount that is before jerusalem and for molech the detestation of the children of ammon\\xa0 and so did he for all his foreign wives who offered and sacrificed unto their gods\\xa0 and the lord was angry with solomon because his heart was turned away from the lord the god of israel who had appeared unto him twice\\xa0 and had commanded him concerning this thing that he should not go after other gods but he kept not that which the lord commanded \\xa0 wherefore the lord said unto solomon forasmuch as this hath been in thy mind and thou hast not kept my covenant and my statutes which i have commanded thee i will surely rend the kingdom from thee and will give it to thy servant\\xa0 notwithstanding in thy days i will not do it for david thy fathers sake but i will rend it out of the hand of thy son\\xa0 howbeit i will not rend away all the kingdom but i will give one',\n",
       "  ' tribe to thy son for david my servants sake and for jerusalems sake which i have chosen s\\xa0 and the lord raised up an adversary unto solomon hadad the edomite he was of the kings seed in edom\\xa0 for it came to pass when david was in edom and joab the captain of the host was gone up to bury the slain and had smitten every male in edom\\xa0 for joab and all israel remained there six months until he had cut off every male in edom\\xa0 that hadad fled he and certain edomites of his fathers servants with him to go into egypt hadad being yet a little child\\xa0 and they arose out of midian and came to paran and they took men with them out of paran and they came to egypt unto pharaoh king of egypt who gave him a house and appointed him victuals and gave him land\\xa0 and hadad found great favour in the sight of pharaoh so that he gave him to wife the sister of his own wife the sister of tahpenes the queen\\xa0 and the sister of tahpenes bore him genubath his son whom tahpenes weaned in pharaohs house and genubath was in pharaohs house among the sons of pharaoh\\xa0 and when hadad heard in egypt that david slept with his fathers and that joab the captain of the host was dead hadad said to pharaoh let me depart that i may go to mine own country\\xa0 then pharaoh said unto him but what hast thou lacked with me that behold thou seekest to go to thine own country and he answered nothing howbeit let me depart in any wise\\xa0 and god raised up another adversary unto him rezon the son of eliada who had fled from his lord hadadezer king of zobah\\xa0 and he gathered men unto him and became captain over a troop when david slew them  and they went to damascus and dwelt therein and reigned in damascus\\xa0 and he was an adversary to israel all the days of solomon beside the mischief that hadad did and he abhorred israel and reigned over aram \\xa0 and jeroboam the son of nebat an ephraimite of zeredah a servant of solomon whose mothers name was zeruah a widow he also lifted up his hand against the king\\xa0 and this was the cause that he lifted up his hand against the king solomon built millo and repaired the breach of the city of david his father\\xa0 and the man jeroboam was a mighty man of valour and solomon saw the young man that he was industrious and he gave him charge over all the labour of the house of joseph s\\xa0 and it came to pass at that time when jeroboam went out of jerusalem that the prophet ahijah the shilonite found him in the way now ahijah had clad himself with a new garment and they two were alone in the field\\xa0 and ahijah laid hold of the new garment that was on him and rent it in twelve pieces\\xa0 and he said to jeroboam take thee ten pieces for thus saith the lord the god of israel behold i will rend the kingdom out of the hand of solomon and will give ten tribes to thee\\xa0 but he shall have one tribe for my servant davids sake and for jerusalems sake the city which i have chosen out of all the tribes of israel\\xa0 because that they have forsaken me and have worshipped ashtoreth the goddess of the zidonians chemosh the god of moab and milcom the god of the children of ammon and they have not walked in my ways to do that which is right in mine eyes and to keep my statutes and mine ordinances as did david his father\\xa0 howbeit i will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand but i will make him prince all the days of his life for david my servants sake whom i chose because he kept my commandments and my statutes\\xa0 but i will take the kingdom out of his sons hand and will give it unto thee even ten tribes\\xa0 and unto his son will i give one tribe that david my servant may have a lamp alway before me in jerusalem the city which i have chosen me to put my name there\\xa0 and i will take thee and thou shalt reign over all that thy soul desireth and shalt be king over israel\\xa0 and it shall be if thou wilt hearken unto all that i command thee and wilt walk in my ways and do that which is right in mine eyes to keep my statutes and my commandments as david my servant did that i will be with thee and will build thee a sure house as i built for david and will give israel unto thee\\xa0 and i will for this afflict the seed of david but not for ever s\\xa0 solomon sought therefore to kill jeroboam but jeroboam arose and fled into egypt unto shishak king of egypt and was in egypt until the death of solomon s\\xa0 now the rest of the acts of solomon and all that he did and his wisdom are they not written in the book of the acts of solomon\\xa0 and the time that solomon reigned in jerusalem over all israel was forty years\\xa0 and solomon slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of david his father and rehoboam his son reigned in his stead s\\xa0 and rehoboam went to shechem for all israel were come to shechem to make him king\\xa0 and it came to pass when jeroboam the son of nebat heard of itfor he was yet in egypt whither he had fled from the presence of king solomon and jeroboam dwelt in egypt\\xa0 and they sent and called himthat jeroboam and all the congregation of israel came and spoke unto rehoboam saying\\xa0 thy father made our yoke grievous now therefore make thou the grievous service of thy father and his heavy yoke which he put upon us lighter and we will serve thee\\xa0 and he said unto them depart yet for three days then come again to me and the people departed\\xa0 and king rehoboam took counsel with the old men that had stood before solomon his father while he yet lived saying what counsel give ye me to return answer to this people\\xa0 and they spoke unto him saying if thou wilt be a servant unto this people this day and wilt serve them and answer them and speak good words to them then they will be thy servants for ever\\xa0 but he forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given him and took counsel with the young men that were grown up with him that stood before him\\xa0 and he said unto them what counsel give ye that we may return answer to this people who have spoken to me saying make the yoke that thy father did put upon us lighter\\xa0 and the young men that were grown up with him spoke unto him saying thus shalt thou say unto this people that spoke unto thee saying thy father made our yoke heavy but make thou it lighter unto us thus shalt thou speak unto them my little finger is thicker than my fathers loins\\xa0 and now whereas my father did burden you with a heavy yoke i will add to your yoke my father chastised you with whips but i will chastise you with scorpions\\xa0 so jeroboam and all the people came to rehoboam the third day as the king bade saying come to me again the third day\\xa0 and the king answered the people roughly and forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given him\\xa0 and spoke to them after the counsel of the young men saying my father made your yoke heavy but i will add to your yoke my father chastised you with whips but i will chastise you with scorpions\\xa0 so the king hearkened not unto the people for it was a thing brought about of the lord that he might establish his word which the lord spoke by the hand of ahijah the shilonite to jeroboam the son of nebat\\xa0 and when all israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them the people answered the king saying what portion have we in david neither have we inheritance in the son of jesse to your tents o israel now see to thine own house david so israel departed unto their tents\\xa0 but as for the children of israel that dwelt in the cities of judah rehoboam reigned over them \\xa0 then king rehoboam sent adoram who was over the levy and all israel stoned him with stones so that he died and king rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot to flee to jerusalem\\xa0 so israel rebelled against the house of david unto this day s\\xa0 and it came to pass when all israel heard that jeroboam was returned that they sent and called him unto the congregation and made him king over all israel there was none that followed the house of david but the tribe of judah only\\xa0 and when rehoboam was come to jerusalem be assembled all the house of judah and the tribe of benjamin a hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men that were warriors to fight against the house of israel to bring the kingdom back to rehoboam the son of solomon \\xa0 but the word of god came unto shemaiah the man of god saying\\xa0 speak unto rehoboam the son of solomon king of judah and unto all the house of judah and benjamin and to the rest of the people saying\\xa0 thus saith the lord ye shall not go up nor fight against your brethren the children of israel return every man to his house for this thing is of me so they hearkened unto the word of the lord and returned and went their way according to the word of the lord s\\xa0 then jeroboam built shechem in the hillcountry of ephraim and dwelt therein and he went out from thence and built penuel\\xa0 and jeroboam said in his heart now will the kingdom return to the house of david\\xa0 if this people go up to offer sacrifices in the house of the lord at jerusalem then will the heart of this people turn back unto their lord even unto rehoboam king of judah and they will kill me and return to rehoboam king of judah\\xa0 whereupon the king took counsel and made two calves of gold and he said unto them ye have gone up long enough to jerusalem behold thy gods o israel which brought thee up out of the land of egypt\\xa0 and he set the one in bethel and the other put he in dan\\xa0 and this thing became a sin for the people went to worship before the one even unto dan\\xa0 and he made houses of high places and made priests from among all the people that were not of the sons of levi\\xa0 and jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month on the fifteenth day of the month like unto the feast that is in judah and he went up unto the altar so did he in bethel to sacrifice unto the calves that he had made and he placed in bethel the priests of the high places that he had made\\xa0 and he went up unto the altar which he had made in bethel on the fifteenth day in the eighth month even in the month which he had devised of his own heart and he ordained a feast for the children of israel and went up unto the altar to offer \\xa0 and behold there came a man of god out of judah by the word of the lord unto bethel and jeroboam was standing by the altar to offer\\xa0 and he cried against the altar by the word of the lord and said o altar altar thus saith the lord behold a son shall be born unto the house of david josiah by name and upon thee shall he sacrifice the priests of the high places that offer upon thee and mens bones shall they burn upon thee\\xa0 and he gave a sign the same day saying this is the sign which the lord hath spoken behold the altar shall be rent and the ashes that are upon it shall be poured out\\xa0 and it came to pass when the king heard the saying of the man of god which he cried against the altar in bethel that jeroboam put forth his hand from the altar saying lay hold on him and his hand which he put forth against him dried up so that he could not draw it back to him\\xa0 the altar also was rent and the ashes poured out from the altar according to the sign which the man of god had given by the word of the lord\\xa0 and the king answered and said unto the man of god entreat now the favour of the lord thy god and pray for me that my hand may be restored me and the man of god entreated the lord and the kings hand was restored him and became as it was before\\xa0 and the king said unto the man of god come home with me and refresh thyself and i will give thee a reward\\xa0 and the man of god said unto the king if thou wilt give me half thy house i will not go in with thee neither will i eat bread nor drink water in this place\\xa0 for it so was charged me by the word of the lord saying thou shalt eat no bread nor drink water neither return by the way that thou camest\\xa0 so he went another way and returned not by the way that he came to bethel \\xa0 now there dwelt an old prophet in bethel and one of his sons came and told him all the works that the man of god had done that day in bethel and the words which he had spoken unto the king and they told them unto their father\\xa0 and their father said unto them what way went he for his sons had seen what way the man of god went that came from judah\\xa0 and he said unto his sons saddle me the ass so they',\n",
       "  ' saddled him the ass and he rode thereon\\xa0 and he went after the man of god and found him sitting under a terebinth and he said unto him art thou the man of god that camest from judah and he said i am\\xa0 then he said unto him come home with me and eat bread\\xa0 and he said i may not return with thee nor go in with thee neither will i eat bread nor drink water with thee in this place\\xa0 for it was said to me by the word of the lord thou shalt eat no bread nor drink water there nor turn back to go by the way that thou camest\\xa0 and he said unto him i also am a prophet as thou art and an angel spoke unto me by the word of the lord saying bring him back with thee into thy house that he may eat bread and drink waterhe lied unto him\\xa0 so he went back with him and did eat bread in his house and drank water\\xa0 and it came to pass as they sat at the table p\\xa0that the word of the lord came unto the prophet that brought him back\\xa0 and he cried unto the man of god that came from judah saying thus saith the lord forasmuch as thou hast rebelled against the word of the lord and hast not kept the commandment which the lord thy god commanded thee\\xa0 but camest back and hast eaten bread and drunk water in the place of which he said to thee eat no bread and drink no water thy carcass shall not come unto the sepulchre of thy fathers\\xa0 and it came to pass after he had eaten bread and after he had drunk that he saddled for him the ass namely for the prophet whom he had brought back\\xa0 and when he was gone a lion met him by the way and slew him and his carcass was cast in the way and the ass stood by it the lion also stood by the carcass\\xa0 and behold men passed by and saw the carcass cast in the way and the lion standing by the carcass and they came and told it in the city where the old prophet dwelt\\xa0 and when the prophet that brought him back from the way heard thereof he said it is the man of god who rebelled against the word of the lord therefore the lord hath delivered him unto the lion which hath torn him and slain him according to the word of the lord which he spoke unto him\\xa0 and he spoke to his sons saying saddle me the ass and they saddled it\\xa0 and he went and found his carcass cast in the way and the ass and the lion standing by the carcass the lion had not eaten the carcass nor torn the ass\\xa0 and the prophet took up the carcass of the man of god and laid it upon the ass and brought it back and he came to the city of the old prophet to lament and to bury him\\xa0 and he laid his carcass in his own grave and they made lamentation for him alas my brother\\xa0 and it came to pass after he had buried him that he spoke to his sons saying when i am dead then bury me in the sepulchre wherein the man of god is buried lay my bones beside his bones\\xa0 for the saying which he cried by the word of the lord against the altar in bethel and against all the houses of the high places which are in the cities of samaria shall surely come to pass \\xa0 after this thing jeroboam returned not from his evil way but made again from among all the people priests of the high places whosoever would he consecrated him that he might be one of the priests of the high places\\xa0 and by this thing there was sin unto the house of jeroboam even to cut it off and to destroy it from off the face of the earth \\xa0 at that time abijah the son of jeroboam fell sick\\xa0 and jeroboam said to his wife arise i pray thee and disguise thyself that thou be not known to be the wife of jeroboam and get thee to shiloh behold there is ahijah the prophet who spoke concerning me that i should be king over this people\\xa0 and take with thee ten loaves and biscuits and a cruse of honey and go to him he will tell thee what shall become of the child\\xa0 and jeroboams wife did so and arose and went to shiloh and came to the house of ahijah now ahijah could not see for his eyes were set by reason of his age \\xa0 now the lord had said unto ahijah behold the wife of jeroboam cometh to inquire of thee concerning her son for he is sick thus and thus shalt thou say unto her for it will be when she cometh in that she will feign herself to be another woman\\xa0 and it was so when ahijah heard the sound of her feet as she came in at the door that he said come in thou wife of jeroboam why feignest thou thyself to be another for i am sent to thee with heavy tidings\\xa0 go tell jeroboam thus saith the lord the god of israel forasmuch as i exalted thee from among the people and made thee prince over my people israel\\xa0 and rent the kingdom away from the house of david and gave it thee and yet thou hast not been as my servant david who kept my commandments and who followed me with all his heart to do that only which was right in mine eyes\\xa0 but hast done evil above all that were before thee and hast gone and made thee other gods and molten images to provoke me and hast cast me behind thy back\\xa0 therefore behold i will bring evil upon the house of jeroboam and will cut off from jeroboam every manchild and him that is shut up and him that is left at large in israel and will utterly sweep away the house of jeroboam as a man sweepeth away dung till it be all gone\\xa0 him that dieth of jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat for the lord hath spoken it\\xa0 arise thou therefore get thee to thy house and when thy feet enter into the city the child shall die\\xa0 and all israel shall make lamentation for him and bury him for he only of jeroboam shall come to the grave because in him there is found some good thing toward the lord the god of israel in the house of jeroboam\\xa0 moreover the lord will raise him up a king over israel who shall cut off the house of jeroboam that day but what is it even then\\xa0 for the lord will smite israel as a reed is shaken in the water and he will root up israel out of this good land which he gave to their fathers and will scatter them beyond the river because they have made their asherim provoking the lord\\xa0 and he will give israel up because of the sins of jeroboam which he hath sinned and wherewith he hath made israel to sin\\xa0 and jeroboams wife arose and departed and came to tirzah and as she came to the threshold of the house the child died\\xa0 and all israel buried him and made lamentation for him according to the word of the lord which he spoke by the hand of his servant ahijah the prophet\\xa0 and the rest of the acts of jeroboam how he warred and how he reigned behold they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel\\xa0 and the days which jeroboam reigned were two and twenty years and he slept with his fathers and nadab his son reigned in his stead \\xa0 and rehoboam the son of solomon reigned in judah rehoboam was forty and one years old when he began to reign and he reigned seventeen years in jerusalem the city which the lord had chosen out of all the tribes of israel to put his name there and his mothers name was naamah the ammonitess\\xa0 and judah did that which was evil in the sight of the lord and they moved him to jealousy with their sins which they committed above all that their fathers had done\\xa0 for they also built them high places and pillars and asherim on every high hill and under every leafy tree\\xa0 and there were also sodomites in the land they did according to all the abominations of the nations which the lord drove out before the children of israel \\xa0 and it came to pass in the fifth year of king rehoboam that shishak king of egypt came up against jerusalem\\xa0 and he took away the treasures of the house of the lord and the treasures of the kings house he even took away all and he took away all the shields of gold which solomon had made\\xa0 and king rehoboam made in their stead shields of brass and committed them to the hands of the captains of the guard who kept the door of the kings house\\xa0 and it was so that as oft as the king went into the house of the lord the guard bore them and brought them back into the guardchamber\\xa0 now the rest of the acts of rehoboam and all that he did are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah\\xa0 and there was war between rehoboam and jeroboam continually\\xa0 and rehoboam slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of david and his mothers name was naamah the ammonitess and abijam his son reigned in his stead \\xa0 now in the eighteenth year of king jeroboam the son of nebat began abijam to reign over judah\\xa0 three years reigned he in jerusalem and his mothers name was maacah the daughter of abishalom\\xa0 and he walked in all the sins of his father which he had done before him and his heart was not whole with the lord his god as the heart of david his father\\xa0 nevertheless for davids sake did the lord his god give him a lamp in jerusalem to set up his son after him and to establish jerusalem\\xa0 because david did that which was right in the eyes of the lord and turned not aside from any thing that he commanded him all the days of his life save only in the matter of uriah the hittite\\xa0 now there was war between rehoboam and jeroboam all the days of his life\\xa0 and the rest of the acts of abijam and all that he did are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah and there was war between abijam and jeroboam\\xa0 and abijam slept with his fathers and they buried him in the city of david and asa his son reigned in his stead \\xa0 and in the twentieth year of jeroboam king of israel began asa to reign over judah\\xa0 and forty and one years reigned he in jerusalem and his mothers name was maacah the daughter of abishalom\\xa0 and asa did that which was right in the eyes of the lord as did david his father\\xa0 and he put away the sodomites out of the land and removed all the idols that his fathers had made\\xa0 and also maacah his mother he removed from being queen because she had made an abominable image for an asherah and asa cut down her image and burnt it at the brook kidron\\xa0 but the high places were not taken away nevertheless the heart of asa was whole with the lord all his days s\\xa0 and he brought into the house of the lord the things that his father had hallowed and the things that himself had hallowed silver and gold and vessels\\xa0 and there was war between asa and baasa king of israel all their days\\xa0 and baasa king of israel went up against judah and built ramah that he might not suffer any to go out or come in to asa king of judah\\xa0 then asa took all the silver and the gold that were left in the treasures of the house of the lord and the treasures of the kings house and delivered them into the hand of his servants and king asa sent them to benhadad the son of tabrimmon the son of hezion king of aram that dwelt at damascus saying\\xa0 there is a league between me and thee between my father and thy father behold i have sent unto thee a present of silver and gold go break thy league with baasa king of israel that he may depart from me\\xa0 and benhadad hearkened unto king asa and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of israel and smote ijon and dan and abelbethmaacah and all chinneroth with all the land of naphtali\\xa0 and it came to pass when baasa heard thereof that he left off building ramah and dwelt in tirzah\\xa0 then king asa made a proclamation unto all judah none was exempted and they carried away the stones of ramah and the timber thereof wherewith baasa had builded and king asa built therewith geba of benjamin and mizpah\\xa0 now the rest of all the acts of asa and all his might and all that he did and the cities which he built are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah but in the time of his old age he was diseased in his feet\\xa0 and asa slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of david his father and jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead \\xa0 and nadab the son of jeroboam began to reign over israel in the second year of asa king of judah and he reigned over israel two years\\xa0 and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord and walked in the way of his father and in his sin wherewith he made israel to sin\\xa0 and baasa the son of ahijah of the house of issachar conspired against him and baasa smote him at gibbethon which belonged to the ph',\n",
       "  'ilistines for nadab and all israel were laying siege to gibbethon\\xa0 even in the third year of asa king of judah did baasa slay him and reigned in his stead\\xa0 and it came to pass that as soon as he was king he smote all the house of jeroboam he left not to jeroboam any that breathed until he had destroyed him according unto the saying of the lord which he spoke by the hand of his servant ahijah the shilonite\\xa0 for the sins of jeroboam which he sinned and wherewith he made israel to sin because of his provocation wherewith he provoked the lord the god of israel\\xa0 now the rest of the acts of nadab and all that he did are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel\\xa0 and there was war between asa and baasa king of israel all their days \\xa0 in the third year of asa king of judah began baasa the son of ahijah to reign over all israel in tirzah and reigned twenty and four years\\xa0 and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord and walked in the way of jeroboam and in his sin wherewith he made israel to sin s\\xa0 and the word of the lord came to jehu the son of hanani against baasa saying\\xa0 forasmuch as i exalted thee out of the dust and made thee prince over my people israel and thou hast walked in the way of jeroboam and hast made my people israel to sin to provoke me with their sins\\xa0 behold i will utterly sweep away baasa and his house and i will make thy house like the house of jeroboam the son of nebat\\xa0 him that dieth of baasa in the city shall the dogs eat and him that dieth of his in the field shall the fowls of the air eat\\xa0 now the rest of the acts of baasa and what he did and his might are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel\\xa0 and baasa slept with his fathers and was buried in tirzah and elah his son reigned in his stead\\xa0 and moreover by the hand of the prophet jehu the son of hanani came the word of the lord against baasa and against his house both because of all the evil that he did in the sight of the lord to provoke him with the work of his hands in being like the house of jeroboam and because he smote him \\xa0 in the twenty and sixth year of asa king of judah began elah the son of baasa to reign over israel in tirzah and reigned two years\\xa0 and his servant zimri captain of half his chariots conspired against him now he was in tirzah drinking himself drunk in the house of arza who was over the household in tirzah\\xa0 and zimri went in and smote him and killed him in the twenty and seventh year of asa king of judah and reigned in his stead\\xa0 and it came to pass when he began to reign as soon as he sat on his throne that he smote all the house of baasa he left him not a single manchild neither of his kinsfolks nor of his friends\\xa0 thus did zimri destroy all the house of baasa according to the word of the lord which he spoke against baasa by jehu the prophet\\xa0 for all the sins of baasa and the sins of elah his son which they sinned and wherewith they made israel to sin to provoke the lord the god of israel with their vanities\\xa0 now the rest of the acts of elah and all that he did are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel \\xa0 in the twenty and seventh year of asa king of judah did zimri reign seven days in tirzah now the people were encamped against gibbethon which belonged to the philistines\\xa0 and the people that were encamped heard say zimri hath conspired and hath also smitten the king wherefore all israel made omri the captain of the host king over israel that day in the camp\\xa0 and omri went up from gibbethon and all israel with him and they besieged tirzah\\xa0 and it came to pass when zimri saw that the city was taken that he went into the castle of the kings house and burnt the kings house over him with fire and died\\xa0 for his sins which he sinned in doing that which was evil in the sight of the lord in walking in the way of jeroboam and in his sin which he did to make israel to sin\\xa0 now the rest of the acts of zimri and his treason that he wrought are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel \\xa0 then were the people of israel divided into two parts half of the people followed tibni the son of ginath to make him king and half followed omri\\xa0 but the people that followed omri prevailed against the people that followed tibni the son of ginath so tibni died and omri reigned \\xa0 in the thirty and first year of asa king of judah began omri to reign over israel and reigned twelve years six years reigned he in tirzah\\xa0 and he bought the hill samaria of shemer for two talents of silver and he built on the hill and called the name of the city which he built after the name of shemer the owner of the hill samaria\\xa0 and omri did that which was evil in the sight of the lord and dealt wickedly above all that were before him\\xa0 for he walked in all the way of jeroboam the son of nebat and in his sins wherewith he made israel to sin to provoke the lord the god of israel with their vanities\\xa0 now the rest of the acts of omri which he did and his might that he showed are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel\\xa0 and omri slept with his fathers and was buried in samaria and ahab his son reigned in his stead \\xa0 and in the thirty and eighth year of asa king of judah began ahab the son of omri to reign over israel and ahab the son of omri reigned over israel in samaria twenty and two years\\xa0 and ahab the son of omri did that which was evil in the sight of the lord above all that were before him\\xa0 and it came to pass as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of jeroboam the son of nebat that he took to wife jezebel the daughter of ethbaal king of the zidonians and went and served baal and worshipped him\\xa0 and he reared up an altar for baal in the house of baal which he had built in samaria\\xa0 and ahab made the asherah and ahab did yet more to provoke the lord the god of israel than all the kings of israel that were before him\\xa0 in his days did hiel the bethelite build jericho with abiram his firstborn he laid the foundation thereof and with his youngest son segub he set up the gates thereof according to the word of the lord which he spoke by the hand of joshua the son of nun s\\xa0 and elijah the tishbite who was of the settlers of gilead said unto ahab as the lord the god of israel liveth before whom i stand there shall not be dew nor rain these years but according to my word s\\xa0 and the word of the lord came unto him saying\\xa0 get thee hence and turn thee eastward and hide thyself by the brook cherith that is before the jordan\\xa0 and it shall be that thou shalt drink of the brook and i have commanded the ravens to feed thee there\\xa0 so he went and did according unto the word of the lord for he went and dwelt by the brook cherith that is before the jordan\\xa0 and the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning and bread and flesh in the evening and he drank of the brook\\xa0 and it came to pass after a while that the brook dried up because there was no rain in the land s\\xa0 and the word of the lord came unto him saying\\xa0 arise get thee to zarephath which belongeth to zidon and dwell there behold i have commanded a widow there to sustain thee\\xa0 so he arose and went to zarephath and when he came to the gate of the city behold a widow was there gathering sticks and he called to her and said fetch me i pray thee a little water in a vessel that i may drink\\xa0 and as she was going to fetch it he called to her and said bring me i pray thee a morsel of bread in thy hand\\xa0 and she said as the lord thy god liveth i have not a cake only a handful of meal in the jar and a little oil in the cruse and behold i am gathering two sticks that i may go in and dress it for me and my son that we may eat it and die\\xa0 and elijah said unto her fear not go and do as thou hast said but make me thereof a little cake first and bring it forth unto me and afterward make for thee and for thy son\\xa0 for thus saith the lord the god of israel the jar of meal shall not be spent neither shall the cruse of oil fail until the day that the lord sendeth rain upon the land\\xa0 and she went and did according to the saying of elijah and she and he and her house did eat many days\\xa0 the jar of meal was not spent neither did the cruse of oil fail according to the word of the lord which he spoke by elijah \\xa0 and it came to pass after these things that the son of the woman the mistress of the house fell sick and his sickness was so sore that there was no breath left in him\\xa0 and she said unto elijah what have i to do with thee o thou man of god art thou come unto me to bring my sin to remembrance and to slay my son\\xa0 and he said unto her give me thy son and he took him out of her bosom and carried him up into the upper chamber where he abode and laid him upon his own bed\\xa0 and he cried unto the lord and said o lord my god hast thou also brought evil upon the widow with whom i sojourn by slaying her son\\xa0 and he stretched himself upon the child three times and cried unto the lord and said o lord my god i pray thee let this childs soul come back into him\\xa0 and the lord hearkened unto the voice of elijah and the soul of the child came back into him and he revived\\xa0 and elijah took the child and brought him down out of the upper chamber into the house and delivered him unto his mother and elijah said see thy son liveth\\xa0 and the woman said to elijah now i know that thou art a man of god and that the word of the lord in thy mouth is truth \\xa0 and it came to pass after many days that the word of the lord came to elijah in the third year saying go show thyself unto ahab and i will send rain upon the land\\xa0 and elijah went to show himself unto ahab and the famine was sore in samaria\\xa0 and ahab called obadiah who was over the householdnow obadiah feared the lord greatly\\xa0 for it was so when jezebel cut off the prophets of the lord that obadiah took a hundred prophets and hid them fifty in a cave and fed them with bread and water\\xa0 and ahab said unto obadiah go through the land unto all the springs of water and unto all the brooks peradventure we may find grass and save the horses and mules alive that we lose not all the beasts\\xa0 so they divided the land between them to pass throughout it ahab went one way by himself and obadiah went another way by himself\\xa0 and as obadiah was in the way behold elijah met him and he knew him and fell on his face and said is it thou my lord elijah\\xa0 and he answered him it is i go tell thy lord behold elijah is here\\xa0 and he said wherein have i sinned that thou wouldest deliver thy servant into the hand of ahab to slay me\\xa0 as the lord thy god liveth there is no nation or kingdom whither my lord hath not sent to seek thee and when they said he is not here he took an oath of the kingdom and nation that they found thee not\\xa0 and now thou sayest go tell thy lord behold elijah is here\\xa0 and it will come to pass as soon as i am gone from thee that the spirit of the lord will carry thee whither i know not and so when i come and tell ahab and he cannot find thee he will slay me but i thy servant fear the lord from my youth\\xa0 was it not told my lord what i did when jezebel slew the prophets of the lord how i hid a hundred men of the lords prophets by fifty in a cave and fed them with bread and water\\xa0 and now thou sayest go tell thy lord behold elijah is here and he will slay me s\\xa0 and elijah said as the lord of hosts liveth before whom i stand i will surely show myself unto him today\\xa0 so obadiah went to meet ahab and told him and ahab went to meet elijah\\xa0 and it came to pass when ahab saw elijah that ahab said unto him is it thou thou troubler of israel\\xa0 and he answered i have not troubled israel but thou and thy fathers house in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the lord and thou hast followed the baalim\\xa0 now therefore send and gather to me all israel unto mount carmel and the prophets of baal four hundred and fifty and the prophets of the asherah four hundred that eat at jezebels table\\xa0 and ahab sent unto all the children of israel and gathered the prophets together unto mount carmel\\xa0 and elijah came near unto all the people and said how long halt ye between two ',\n",
       "  'opinions if the lord be god follow him but if baal follow him and the people answered him not a word\\xa0 then said elijah unto the people i even i only am left a prophet of the lord but baals prophets are four hundred and fifty men\\xa0 let them therefore give us two bullocks and let them choose one bullock for themselves and cut it in pieces and lay it on the wood and put no fire under and i will dress the other bullock and lay it on the wood and put no fire under\\xa0 and call ye on the name of your god and i will call on the name of the lord and the god that answereth by fire let him be god and all the people answered and said it is well spoken\\xa0 and elijah said unto the prophets of baal choose you one bullock for yourselves and dress it first for ye are many and call on the name of your god but put no fire under\\xa0 and they took the bullock which was given them and they dressed it and called on the name of baal from morning even until noon saying o baal answer us but there was no voice nor any that answered and they danced in halting wise about the altar which was made\\xa0 and it came to pass at noon that elijah mocked them and said cry aloud for he is a god either he is musing or he is gone aside or he is in a journey or peradventure he sleepeth and must be awaked\\xa0 and they cried aloud and cut themselves after their manner with swords and lances till the blood gushed out upon them\\xa0 and it was so when midday was past that they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening offering but their was neither voice nor any to answer nor any that regarded\\xa0 and elijah said unto all the people come near unto me and all the people came near unto him and he repaired the altar of the lord that was thrown down\\xa0 and elijah took twelve stones according to the number of the tribes of the sons of jacob unto whom the word of the lord came saying israel shall be thy name\\xa0 and with the stones he built an altar in the name of the lord and he made a trench about the altar as great as would contain two measures of seed\\xa0 and he put the wood in order and cut the bullock in pieces and laid it on the wood\\xa0 and he said fill four jars with water and pour it on the burntoffering and on the wood and he said do it the second time and they did it the second time and he said do it the third time and they did it the third time\\xa0 and the water ran round about the altar and he filled the trench also with water\\xa0 and it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening offering that elijah the prophet came near and said o lord the god of abraham of isaac and of israel let it be known this day that thou art god in israel and that i am thy servant and that i have done all these things at thy word\\xa0 hear me o lord hear me that this people may know that thou lord art god for thou didst turn their heart backward\\xa0 then the fire of the lord fell and consumed the burntoffering and the wood and the stones and the dust and licked up the water that was in the trench\\xa0 and when all the people saw it they fell on their faces and they said the lord he is god the lord he is god\\xa0 and elijah said unto them take the prophets of baal let not one of them escape and they took them and elijah brought them down to the brook kishon and slew them there\\xa0 and elijah said unto ahab get thee up eat and drink for there is the sound of abundance of rain\\xa0 so ahab went up to eat and to drink and elijah went up to the top of carmel and he bowed himself down upon the earth and put his face between his knees\\xa0 and he said to his servant go up now look toward the sea and he went up and looked and said there is nothing and he said go again seven times\\xa0 and it came to pass at the seventh time that he said behold there ariseth a cloud out of the sea as small as a mans hand and he said go up say unto ahab make ready thy chariot and get thee down that the rain stop thee not\\xa0 and it came to pass in a little while that the heaven grew black with clouds and wind and there was a great rain and ahab rode and went to jezreel\\xa0 and the hand of the lord was on elijah and he girded up his loins and ran before ahab to the entrance of jezreel\\xa0 and ahab told jezebel all that elijah had done and withal how he had slain all the prophets with the sword\\xa0 then jezebel sent a messenger unto elijah saying so let the gods do  and more also if i make not thy life as the life of one of them by tomorrow about this time\\xa0 and when he saw that he arose and went for his life and came to beersheba which belongeth to judah and left his servant there\\xa0 but he himself went a days journey into the wilderness and came and sat down under a broomtree and he requested for himself that he might die and said it is enough now o lord take away my life for i am not better than my fathers\\xa0 and he lay down and slept under a broomtree and behold an angel touched him and said unto him arise and eat\\xa0 and he looked and behold there was at his head a cake baked on the hot stones and a cruse of water and he did eat and drink and laid him down again\\xa0 and the angel of the lord came again the second time and touched him and said arise and eat because the journey is too great for thee\\xa0 and he arose and did eat and drink and went in the strength of that meal forty days and forty nights unto horeb the mount of god\\xa0 and he came thither unto a cave and lodged there and behold the word of the lord came to him and he said unto him what doest thou here elijah\\xa0 and he said i have been very jealous for the lord the god of hosts for the children of israel have forsaken thy covenant thrown down thine altars and slain thy prophets with the sword and i even i only am left and they seek my life to take it away\\xa0 and he said go forth and stand upon the mount before the lord and behold the lord passed by and a great and strong wind rent the mountains and broke in pieces the rocks before the lord but the lord was not in the wind and after the wind an earthquake but the lord was not in the earthquake\\xa0 and after the earthquake a fire but the lord was not in the fire and after the fire a still small voice\\xa0 and it was so when elijah heard it that he wrapped his face in his mantle and went out and stood in the entrance of the cave and behold there came a voice unto him and said what doest thou here elijah\\xa0 and he said i have been very jealous for the lord the god of hosts for the children of israel have forsaken thy covenant thrown down thine altars and slain thy prophets with the sword and i even i only am left and they seek my life to take it away s\\xa0 and the lord said unto him go return on thy way to the wilderness of damascus and when thou comest thou shalt anoint hazael to be king over aram\\xa0 and jehu the son of nimshi shalt thou anoint to be king over israel and elisha the son of shaphat of abelmeholah shalt thou anoint to be prophet in thy room\\xa0 and it shall come to pass that him that escapeth from the sword of hazael shall jehu slay and him that escapeth from the sword of jehu shall elisha slay\\xa0 yet will i leave seven thousand in israel all the knees which have not bowed unto baal and every mouth which hath not kissed him\\xa0 so he departed thence and found elisha the son of shaphat who was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen before him and he with the twelfth and elijah passed over unto him and cast his mantle upon him\\xa0 and he left the oxen and ran after elijah and said let me i pray thee kiss my father and my mother and then i will follow thee and he said unto him go back for what have i done to thee\\xa0 and he returned from following him and took the yoke of oxen and slew them and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen and gave unto the people and they did eat then he arose and went after elijah and ministered unto him \\xa0 and benhadad the king of aram gathered all his host together and there were thirty and two kings with him and horses and chariots and he went up and besieged samaria and fought against it\\xa0 and he sent messengers to ahab king of israel into the city\\xa0 and said unto him thus saith benhadad thy silver and thy gold is mine thy wives also and thy children even the goodliest are mine\\xa0 and the king of israel answered and said it is according to thy saying my lord o king i am thine and all that i have\\xa0 and the messengers came again and said thus speaketh benhadad saying i sent indeed unto thee saying thou shalt deliver me thy silver and thy gold and thy wives and thy children\\xa0 but i will send my servants unto thee tomorrow about this time and they shall search thy house and the houses of thy servants and it shall be that whatsoever is pleasant in thine eyes they shall put it in their hand and take it away\\xa0 then the king of israel called all the elders of the land and said mark i pray you and see how this man seeketh mischief for he sent unto me for my wives and for my children and for my silver and for my gold and i denied him not\\xa0 and all the elders and all the people said unto him hearken thou not neither consent\\xa0 wherefore he said unto the messengers of benhadad tell my lord the king all that thou didst send for to thy servant at the first i will do but this thing i may not do and the messengers departed and brought him back word\\xa0 and benhadad sent unto him and said the gods do so unto me and more also if the dust of samaria shall suffice for handfuls for all the people that follow me\\xa0 and the king of israel answered and said tell him let not him that girdeth on his armour boast himself as he that putteth it off\\xa0 and it came to pass when  heard this message as he was drinking he and the kings in the booths that he said unto his servants set yourselves in array and they set themselves in array against the city\\xa0 and behold a prophet came near unto ahab king of israel and said thus saith the lord hast thou seen all this great multitude behold i will deliver it into thy hand this day and thou shalt know that i am the lord\\xa0 and ahab said by whom and he said thus saith the lord by the young men of the princes of the provinces then he said who shall begin the battle and he answered thou\\xa0 then he numbered the young men of the princes of the provinces and they were two hundred and thirtytwo and after them he numbered all the people even all the children of israel being seven thousand\\xa0 and they went out at noon but benhadad was drinking himself drunk in the booths he and the kings the thirty and two kings that helped him\\xa0 and the young men of the princes of the provinces went out first and benhadad sent out and they told him saying there are men come out from samaria\\xa0 and he said whether they are come out for peace take them alive or whether they are come out for war take them alive\\xa0 so these went out of the city the young men of the princes of the provinces and the army which followed them\\xa0 and they slew every one his man and the arameans fled and israel pursued them and benhadad the king of aram escaped on a horse with horsemen\\xa0 and the king of israel went out and smote the horses and chariots and slew the arameans with a great slaughter\\xa0 and the prophet came near to the king of israel and said unto him go strengthen thyself and mark and see what thou doest for at the return of the year the king of aram will come up against thee \\xa0 and the servants of the king of aram said unto him their god is a god of the hills therefore they were stronger than we but let us fight against them in the plain and surely we shall be stronger than they\\xa0 and do this thing take the kings away every man out of his place and put governors in their room\\xa0 and number thee an army like the army that thou hast lost horse for horse and chariot for chariot and we will fight against them in the plain and surely we shall be stronger than they and he hearkened unto their voice and did so \\xa0 and it came to pass at the return of the year that benhadad mustered the arameans and went up to aphek to fight against israel\\xa0 and the children of israel were mustered and were victualled and went against them and the children of israel encamped before them like two little flocks of kids but the arameans filled the country\\xa0 and a man of god came near and spoke unto the king of israel and sai',\n",
       "  'd thus saith the lord because the arameans have said the lord is a god of the hills but he is not a god of the valleys therefore will i deliver all this great multitude into thy hand and ye shall know that i am the lord\\xa0 and they encamped one over against the other seven days and so it was that in the seventh day the battle was joined and the children of israel slew of the arameans a hundred thousand footmen in one day\\xa0 but the rest fled to aphek into the city and the wall fell upon twenty and seven thousand men that were left and benhadad fled and came into the city into an inner chamber\\xa0 and his servants said unto him behold now we have heard that the kings of the house of israel are merciful kings let us we pray thee put sackcloth on our loins and ropes upon our heads and go out to the king of israel peradventure he will save thy life\\xa0 so they girded sackcloth on their loins and put ropes on their heads and came to the king of israel and said thy servant benhadad saith i pray thee let me live and he said is he yet alive he is my brother\\xa0 now the men took it for a sign and hastened to catch it from him and they said thy brother benhadad then he said go ye bring him then benhadad came forth to him and he caused him to come up into his chariot\\xa0 and  said unto him the cities which my father took from thy father i will restore and thou shalt make streets for thee in damascus as my father made in samaria and i will let thee go with this covenant so he made a covenant with him and let him go s\\xa0 and a certain man of the sons of the prophets said unto his fellow by the word of the lord smite me i pray thee and the man refused to smite him\\xa0 then said he unto him because thou hast not hearkened to the voice of the lord behold as soon as thou art departed from me a lion shall slay thee and as soon as he was departed from him a lion found him and slew him\\xa0 then he found another man and said smite me i pray thee and the man smote him smiting and wounding him\\xa0 so the prophet departed and waited for the king by the way and disguised himself with his headband over his eyes\\xa0 and as the king passed by he cried unto the king and he said thy servant went out into the midst of the battle and behold a man turned aside and brought a man unto me and said keep this man if by any means he be missing then shall thy life be for his life or else thou shalt pay a talent of silver\\xa0 and as thy servant was busy here and there he was gone and the king of israel said unto him so shall thy judgment be thyself hast decided it\\xa0 and he hastened and took the headband away from his eyes and the king of israel discerned him that he was of the prophets\\xa0 and he said unto him thus saith the lord because thou hast let go out of thy hand the man whom i had devoted to destruction therefore thy life shall go for his life and thy people for his people\\xa0 and the king of israel went to his house sullen and displeased and came to samaria \\xa0 and it came to pass after these things that naboth the jezreelite had a vineyard which was in jezreel hard by the palace of ahab king of samaria\\xa0 and ahab spoke unto naboth saying give me thy vineyard that i may have it for a garden of herbs because it is near unto my house and i will give thee for it a better vineyard than it or if it seem good to thee i will give thee the worth of it in money\\xa0 and naboth said to ahab the lord forbid it me that i should give the inheritance of my fathers unto thee\\xa0 and ahab came into his house sullen and displeased because of the word which naboth the jezreelite had spoken to him for he had said i will not give thee the inheritance of my fathers and he laid him down upon his bed and turned away his face and would eat no bread\\xa0 but jezebel his wife came to him and said unto him why is thy spirit so sullen that thou eatest no bread\\xa0 and he said unto her because i spoke unto naboth the jezreelite and said unto him give me thy vineyard for money or else if it please thee i will give thee another vineyard for it and he answered i will not give thee my vineyard\\xa0 and jezebel his wife said unto him dost thou now govern the kingdom of israel arise and eat bread and let thy heart be merry i will give thee the vineyard of naboth the jezreelite\\xa0 so she wrote letters in ahabs name and sealed them with his seal and sent the letters unto the elders and to the nobles that were in his city and that dwelt with naboth\\xa0 and she wrote in the letters saying proclaim a fast and set naboth at the head of the people\\xa0 and set two men base fellows before him and let them bear witness against him saying thou didst curse god and the king and then carry him out and stone him that he die\\xa0 and the men of his city even the elders and the nobles who dwelt in his city did as jezebel had sent unto them according as it was written in the letters which she had sent unto them\\xa0 they proclaimed a fast and set naboth at the head of the people\\xa0 and the two men the base fellows came in and sat before him and the base fellows bore witness against him even against naboth in the presence of the people saying naboth did curse god and the king then they carried him forth out of the city and stoned him with stones that he died\\xa0 then they sent to jezebel saying naboth is stoned and is dead\\xa0 and it came to pass when jezebel heard that naboth was stoned and was dead that jezebel said to ahab arise take possession of the vineyard of naboth the jezreelite which he refused to give thee for money for naboth is not alive but dead\\xa0 and it came to pass when ahab heard that naboth was dead that ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of naboth the jezreelite to take possession of it \\xa0 and the word of the lord came to elijah the tishbite saying\\xa0 arise go down to meet ahab king of israel who dwelleth in samaria behold he is in the vineyard of naboth whither he is gone down to take possession of it\\xa0 and thou shalt speak unto him saying thus saith the lord hast thou killed and also taken possessions and thou shalt speak unto him saying thus saith the lord in the place where dogs licked the blood of naboth shall dogs lick thy blood even thine\\xa0 and ahab said to elijah hast thou found me o mine enemy and he answered i have found thee because thou hast given thyself over to do that which is evil in the sight of the lord\\xa0 behold i will bring evil upon thee and will utterly sweep thee away and will cut off from ahab every manchild and him that is shut up and him that is left at large in israel\\xa0 and i will make thy house like the house of jeroboam the son of nebat and like the house of baasa the son of ahijah for the provocation wherewith thou hast provoked me and hast made israel to sin\\xa0 and of jezebel also spoke the lord saying the dogs shall eat jezebel in the moat of jezreel\\xa0 him that dieth of ahab in the city the dogs shall eat and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat\\xa0 but there was none like unto ahab who did give himself over to do that which was evil in the sight of the lord whom jezebel his wife stirred up\\xa0 and he did very abominably in following idols according to all that the amorites did whom the lord cast out before the children of israel \\xa0 and it came to pass when ahab heard those words that he rent his clothes and put sackcloth upon his flesh and fasted and lay in sackcloth and went softy \\xa0 and the word of the lord came to elijah the tishbite saying\\xa0 seest thou how ahab humbleth himself before me because he humbleth himself before me i will not bring the evil in his days but in his sons days will i bring the evil upon his house\\xa0 and they continued three years without war between aram and israel \\xa0 and it came to pass in the third year that jehoshaphat the king of judah came down to the king of israel\\xa0 and the king of israel said unto his servants know ye that ramothgilead is ours and we are still and take it not out of the hand of the king of aram\\xa0 and he said unto jehoshaphat wilt thou go with me to battle to ramothgilead and jehoshaphat said to the king of israel i am as thou art my people as thy people my horses as thy horses\\xa0 and jehoshaphat said unto the king of israel inquire i pray thee at the word of the lord today\\xa0 then the king of israel gathered the prophets together about four hundred men and said unto them shall i go against ramothgilead to battle or shall i forbear and they said go up for the lord will deliver it into the hand of the king\\xa0 but jehoshaphat said is there not here besides a prophet of the lord that we might inquire of him\\xa0 and the king of israel said unto jehoshaphat there is yet one man by whom we may inquire of the lord micaiah the son of imlah but i hate him for he doth not prophesy good concerning me but evil and jehoshaphat said let not the king say so\\xa0 then the king of israel called an officer and said fetch quickly micaiah the son of imlah\\xa0 now the king of israel and jehoshaphat the king of judah sat each on his throne arrayed in their robes in a threshingfloor at the entrance of the gate of samaria and all the prophets prophesied before them\\xa0 and zedekiah the son of chenaanah made him horns of iron and said thus saith the lord with these shalt thou gore the arameans until they be consumed\\xa0 and all the prophets prophesied so saying go up to ramothgilead and prosper for the lord will deliver it into the hand of the king\\xa0 and the messenger that went to call micaiah spoke unto him saying behold now the words of the prophets declare good unto the king with one mouth let thy word i pray thee be like the word of one of them and speak thou good\\xa0 and micaiah said as the lord liveth what the lord saith unto me that will i speak\\xa0 and when he was come to the king the king said unto him micaiah shall we go to ramothgilead to battle or shall we forbear and he answered him go up and prosper and the lord will deliver it into the hand of the king\\xa0 and the king said unto him how many times shall i adjure thee that thou speak unto me nothing but the truth in the name of the lord\\xa0 and he said i saw all israel scattered upon the mountains as sheep that have no shepherd and the lord said these have no master let them return every man to his house in peace\\xa0 and the king of israel said to jehoshaphat did i not tell thee that he would not prophesy good concerning me but evil s\\xa0 and he said therefore hear thou the word of the lord i saw the lord sitting on his throne and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left\\xa0 and the lord said who shall entice ahab that he may go up and fall at ramothgilead and one said on this manner and another said on that manner\\xa0 and there came forth the spirit and stood before the lord and said i will entice him\\xa0 and the lord said unto him wherewith and he said i will go forth and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets and he said thou shalt entice him and shalt prevail also go forth and do so\\xa0 now therefore behold the lord hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophets and the lord hath spoken evil concerning thee\\xa0 then zedekiah the son of chenaanah came near and smote micaiah on the cheek and said which way went the spirit of the lord from me to speak unto thee\\xa0 and micaiah said behold thou shalt see on that day when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself\\xa0 and the king of israel said take micaiah and carry him back unto amon the governor of the city and to joash the kings son\\xa0 and say thus saith the king put this fellow in the prison and feed him with scant bread and with scant water until i come in peace\\xa0 and micaiah said if thou return at all in peace the lord hath not spoken by me and he said hear ye peoples all of you\\xa0 so the king of israel and jehoshaphat the king of judah went up to ramothgilead\\xa0 and the king of israel said unto jehoshaphat i will disguise myself and go into the battle but put thou on thy robes and the king of israel disguised himself and went into the battle\\xa0 now the king of aram had commanded the thirty and two captains of his chariots saying fight neither with small nor great save only with the king of israel\\xa0 and it came to pass when the captains of the chariots saw jehoshaphat t',\n",
       "  'hat they said surely it is the king of israel and they turned aside to fight against him and jehoshaphat cried out\\xa0 and it came to pass when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of israel that they turned back from pursuing him\\xa0 and a certain man drew his bow at a venture and smote the king of israel between the lower armour and the breastplate wherefore he said unto the driver of his chariot turn thy hand and carry me out of the host for i am sore wounded\\xa0 and the battle increased that day and the king was stayed up in his chariot against the arameans and died at even and the blood ran out of the wound into the bottom of the chariot\\xa0 and there went a cry throughout the host about the going down of the sun saying every man to his city and every man to his country\\xa0 so the king died and was brought to samaria and they buried the king in samaria\\xa0 and they washed the chariot by the pool of samaria and the dogs licked up his blood the harlots also washed themselves there according unto the word of the lord which he spoke\\xa0 now the rest of the acts of ahab and all that he did and the ivory house which he built and all the cities that he built are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel\\xa0 so ahab slept with his fathers and ahaziah his son reigned in his stead \\xa0 and jehoshaphat the son of asa began to reign over judah in the fourth year of ahab king of israel\\xa0 jehoshaphat was thirty and five years old when he began to reign and he reigned twenty and five years in jerusalem and his mothers name was azubah the daughter of shilhi\\xa0 and he walked in all the way of asa his father he turned not aside from it doing that which was right in the eyes of the lord\\xa0 howbeit the high places were not taken away the people still sacrificed and offered in the high places\\xa0 and jehoshaphat made peace with the king of israel\\xa0 now the rest of the acts of jehoshaphat and his might that he showed and how he warred are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah\\xa0 and the remnant of the sodomites that remained in the days of his father asa he put away out of the land\\xa0 and there was no king in edom a deputy was king\\xa0 jehoshaphat made ships of tarshish to go to ophir for gold but they went not for the ships were broken at eziongeber\\xa0 then said ahaziah the son of ahab unto jehoshaphat let my servants go with thy servants in the ships but jehoshaphat would not\\xa0 and jehoshaphat slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of david his father and jehoram his son reigned in his stead s\\xa0 ahaziah the son of ahab began to reign over israel in samaria in the seventeenth year of jehoshaphat king of judah and he reigned two years over israel\\xa0 and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord and walked in the way of his father and in the way of his mother and in the way of jeroboam the son of nebat wherein he made israel to sin\\xa0 and he served baal and worshipped him and provoked the lord the god of israel according to all that his father had done\\xa0 and moab rebelled against israel after the death of ahab\\xa0 and ahaziah fell down through the lattice in his upper chamber that was in samaria and was sick and he sent messengers and said unto them go inquire of baalzebub the god of ekron whether i shall recover of this sickness s\\xa0 but an angel of the lord said to elijah the tishbite arise go up to meet the messengers of the king of samaria and say unto them is it because there is no god in israel that ye go to inquire of baalzebub the god of ekron\\xa0 now therefore thus saith the lord thou shalt not come down from the bed whither thou art gone up but shalt surely die and elijah departed\\xa0 and the messengers returned unto him and he said unto them why is it that ye are returned\\xa0 and they said unto him there came up a man to meet us and said unto us go return unto the king that sent you and say unto him thus saith the lord is it because there is no god in israel that thou sendest to inquire of baalzebub the god of ekron therefore thou shalt not come down from the bed whither thou art gone up but shalt surely die\\xa0 and he said unto them what manner of man was he that came up to meet you and told you these words\\xa0 and they answered him he was a hairy man and girt with a girdle of leather about his loins and he said it is elijah the tishbite\\xa0 then the king sent unto him a captain of fifty with his fifty and he went up to him and behold he sat on the top of the hill and he spoke unto him o man of god the king hath said come down\\xa0 and elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty if i be a man of god let fire come down from heaven and consume thee and thy fifty and there came down fire from heaven and consumed him and his fifty\\xa0 and again he sent unto him another captain of fifty with his fifty and he answered and said unto him o man of god thus hath the king said come down quickly\\xa0 and elijah answered and said unto them if i be a man of god let fire come down from heaven and consume thee and thy fifty and the fire of god came down from heaven and consumed him and his fifty\\xa0 and again he sent the captain of a third fifty with his fifty and the third captain of fifty went up and came and fell on his knees before elijah and besought him and said unto him o man of god i pray thee let my life and the life of these fifty thy servants be precious in thy sight\\xa0 behold there came fire down from heaven and consumed the two former captains of fifty with their fifties but now let my life be precious in thy sight s\\xa0 and the angel of the lord said unto elijah go down with him be not afraid of him and he arose and went down with him unto the king\\xa0 and he said unto him thus saith the lord forasmuch as thou hast sent messengers to inquire of baalzebub the god of ekron is it because there is no god in israel to inquire of his word therefore thou shalt not come down from the bed whether thou art gone up but shalt surely die\\xa0 so he died according to the word of the lord which elijah had spoken and jehoram began to reign in his stead p\\xa0in the second year of jehoram the son of jehoshaphat king of judah because he had no son s\\xa0 now the rest of the acts of ahaziah which he did are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel \\xa0 and it came to pass when the lord would take up elijah by a whirlwind into heaven that elijah went with elisha from gilgal\\xa0 and elijah said unto elisha tarry here i pray thee for the lord hath sent me as far as bethel and elisha said as the lord liveth and as thy soul liveth i will not leave thee so they went down to bethel\\xa0 and the sons of the prophets that were at bethel came forth to elisha and said unto him knowest thou that the lord will take away thy master from thy head today and he said yea i know it hold ye your peace\\xa0 and elijah said unto him elisha tarry here i pray thee for the lord hath sent me to jericho and he said as the lord liveth and as thy soul liveth i will not leave thee so they came to jericho\\xa0 and the sons of the prophets that were at jericho came near to elisha and said unto him knowest thou that the lord will take away thy master from thy head today and he answered yea i know it hold ye your peace\\xa0 and elijah said unto him tarry here i pray thee for the lord hath sent me to the jordan and he said as the lord liveth and as thy soul liveth i will not leave thee and they two went on\\xa0 and fifty men of the sons of the prophets went and stood over against them afar off and they two stood by the jordan\\xa0 and elijah took his mantle and wrapped it together and smote the waters and they were divided hither and thither so that they two went over on dry ground\\xa0 and it came to pass when they were gone over that elijah said unto elisha ask what i shall do for thee before i am taken from thee and elisha said i pray thee let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me\\xa0 and he said thou hast asked a hard thing nevertheless if thou see me when i am taken from thee it shall be so unto thee but if not it shall not be so\\xa0 and it came to pass as they still went on and talked that behold there appeared a chariot of fire and horses of fire which parted them both asunder and elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven\\xa0 and elisha saw it and he cried my father my father the chariots of israel and the horsemen thereof and he saw him no more and he took hold of his own clothes and rent them in two pieces\\xa0 he took up also the mantle of elijah that fell from him and went back and stood by the bank of the jordan\\xa0 and he took the mantle of elijah that fell from him and smote the waters and said where is the lord the god of elijah and when he also had smitten the waters they were divided hither and thither and elisha went over\\xa0 and when the sons of the prophets that were at jericho some way off saw him they said the spirit of elijah doth rest on elisha and they came to meet him and bowed down to the ground before him\\xa0 and they said unto him behold now there are with thy servants fifty strong men let them go we pray thee and seek thy master lest peradventure the spirit of the lord hath taken him up and cast him upon some mountain or into some valley and he said ye shall not send\\xa0 and when they urged him till he was ashamed he said send they sent therefore fifty men and they sought three days but found him not\\xa0 and they came back to him while he tarried at jericho and he said unto them did i not say unto you go not s\\xa0 and the men of the city said unto elisha behold we pray thee the situation of this city is pleasant as my lord seeth but the water is bad and the land miscarrieth\\xa0 and he said bring me a new cruse and put salt therein and they brought it to him\\xa0 and he went forth unto the spring of the waters and cast salt therein and said thus saith the lord i have healed these waters there shall not be from thence any more death or miscarrying\\xa0 so the waters were healed unto this day according to the word of elisha which he spoke \\xa0 and he went up from thence unto bethel and as he was going up by the way there came forth little children out of the city and mocked him and said unto him go up thou baldhead go up thou baldhead\\xa0 and he looked behind him and saw them and cursed them in the name of the lord and there came forth two shebears out of the wood and tore forty and two children of them\\xa0 and he went from thence to mount carmel and from thence he returned to samaria \\xa0 now jehoram the son of ahab began to reign over israel in samaria in the eighteenth year of jehoshaphat king of judah and reigned twelve years\\xa0 and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord but not like his father and like his mother for he put away the pillar of baal that his father had made\\xa0 nevertheless he cleaved unto the sins of jeroboam the son of nebat wherewith he made israel to sin he departed not therefrom \\xa0 now mesha king of moab was a sheepmaster and he rendered unto the king of israel the wool of a hundred thousand lambs and of a hundred thousand rams\\xa0 but it came to pass when ahab was dead that the king of moab rebelled against the king of israel\\xa0 and king jehoram went out of samaria at that time and mustered all israel\\xa0 and he went and sent to jehoshaphat the king of judah saying the king of moab hath rebelled against me wilt thou go with me against moab to battle and he said i will go up i am as thou art my people as thy people my horses as thy horses\\xa0 and he said which way shall we go up and he answered the way of the wilderness of edom\\xa0 so the king of israel went and the king of judah and the king of edom and they made a circuit of seven days journey and there was no water for the host nor for the beasts that followed them\\xa0 and the king of israel said alas for the lord hath called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of moab s\\xa0 but jehoshaphat said is there not here a prophet of the lord that we may inquire of the lord by him and one of the king of israels servants answered and said elisha the son of shaphat is here who poured water on the hands of elijah\\xa0 and jehoshaphat said the word of the lord is with him so the king of israel and jehoshaph',\n",
       "  'at and the king of edom went down to him\\xa0 and elisha said unto the king of israel what have i to do with thee get thee to the prophets of thy father and to the prophets of thy mother and the king of israel said unto him nay for the lord hath called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of moab\\xa0 and elisha said as the lord of hosts liveth before whom i stand surely were it not that i regard the presence of jehoshaphat the king of judah i would not look toward thee nor see thee\\xa0 but now bring me a minstrel and it came to pass when the minstrel played that the hand of the lord came upon him\\xa0 and he said thus saith the lord make this valley full of trenches\\xa0 for thus saith the lord ye shall not see wind neither shall ye see rain yet that valley shall be filled with water and ye shall drink both ye and your cattle and your beasts\\xa0 and this is but a light thing in the sight of the lord he will also deliver the moabites into your hand\\xa0 and ye shall smite every fortified city and every choice city and shall fell every good tree and stop all fountains of water and mar every good piece of land with stones\\xa0 and it came to pass in the morning about the time of making the offering that behold there came water by the way of edom and the country was filled with water\\xa0 now when all the moabites heard that the kings were come up to fight against them they gathered themselves together all that were able to put on armour and upward and stood on the border\\xa0 and they rose up early in the morning and the sun shone upon the water and the moabites saw the water some way off as red as blood\\xa0 and they said this is blood the kings have surely fought together and they have smitten each man his fellow now therefore moab to the spoil\\xa0 and when they came to the camp of israel the israelites rose up and smote the moabites so that they fled before them and they smote the land even moab mightily\\xa0 and they beat down the cities and on every good piece of land they cast every man his stone and filled it and they stopped all the fountains of water and felled all the good trees until there was left only kirhareseth with the stones of the wall thereof so the slingers encompassed it and smote it\\xa0 and when the king of moab saw that the battle was too sore for him he took with him seven hundred men that drew sword to break through unto the king of edom but they could not\\xa0 then he took his eldest son that should have reigned in his stead and offered him for a burntoffering upon the wall and there came great wrath upon israel and they departed from him and returned to their own land \\xa0 now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets unto elisha saying thy servant my husband is dead and thou knowest that thy servant did fear the lord and the creditor is come to take unto him my two children to be bondmen\\xa0 and elisha said unto her what shall i do for thee tell me what hast thou in the house and she said thy handmaid hath not any thing in the house save a pot of oil\\xa0 then he said go borrow thee vessels abroad of all thy neighbours even empty vessels borrow not a few\\xa0 and thou shalt go in and shut the door upon thee and upon thy sons and pour out into all those vessels and thou shalt set aside that which is full\\xa0 so she went from him and shut the door upon her and upon her sons they brought the vessels to her and she poured out\\xa0 and it came to pass when the vessels were full that she said unto her son bring me yet a vessel and he said unto her there is not a vessel more and the oil stayed\\xa0 then she came and told the man of god and he said go sell the oil and pay thy debt and live thou and thy sons of the rest \\xa0 and it fell on a day that elisha passed to shunem where was a great woman and she constrained him to eat bread and so it was that as oft as he passed by he turned in thither to eat bread\\xa0 and she said unto her husband behold now i perceive that this is a holy man of god that passeth by us continually\\xa0 let us make i pray thee a little chamber on the roof and let us set for him there a bed and a table and a stool and a candlestick and it shall be when he cometh to us that he shall turn in thither\\xa0 and it fell on a day that he came thither and he turned into the upper chamber and lay there\\xa0 and he said to gehazi his servant call this shunammite and when he had called her she stood before him\\xa0 and he said unto him say now unto her behold thou hast been careful for us with all this care what is to be done for thee wouldest thou be spoken for to the king or to the captain of the host and she answered i dwell among mine own people\\xa0 and he said what then is to be done for her and gehazi answered verily she hath no son and her husband is old\\xa0 and he said call her and when he had called her she stood in the door\\xa0 and he said at this season when the time cometh round thou shalt embrace a son and she said nay my lord thou man of god do not lie unto thy handmaid\\xa0 and the woman conceived and bore a son at that season when the time came round as elisha had said unto her\\xa0 and when the child was grown it fell on a day that he went out to his father to the reapers\\xa0 and he said unto his father my head my head and he said to his servant carry him to his mother\\xa0 and when he had taken him and brought him to his mother he sat on her knees till noon and then died\\xa0 and she went up and laid him on the bed of the man of god and shut the door upon him and went out\\xa0 and she called unto her husband and said send me i pray thee one of the servants and one of the asses that i may run to the man of god and come back\\xa0 and he said wherefore wilt thou go to him today it is neither new moon nor sabbath and she said it shall be well\\xa0 then she saddled an ass and said to her servant drive and go forward slacken me not the riding except i bid thee\\xa0 so she went and came unto the man of god to mount carmel and it came to pass when the man of god saw her afar off that he said to gehazi his servant behold yonder is that shunammite\\xa0 run i pray thee now to meet her and say unto her is it well with thee is it well with thy husband is it well with the child and she answered it is well\\xa0 and when she came to the man of god to the hill she caught hold of his feet and gehazi came near to thrust her away but the man of god said let her alone for her soul is bitter within her and the lord hath hid it from me and hath not told me\\xa0 then she said did i desire a son of my lord did i not say do not deceive me\\xa0 then he said to gehazi gird up thy loins and take my staff in thy hand and go thy way if thou meet any man salute him not and if any salute thee answer him not and lay my staff upon the face of the child\\xa0 and the mother of the child said as the lord liveth and as thy soul liveth i will not leave thee and he arose and followed her\\xa0 and gehazi passed on before them and laid the staff upon the face of the child but there was neither voice nor hearing wherefore he returned to meet him and told him saying the child is not awaked\\xa0 and when elisha was come into the house behold the child was dead and laid upon his bed\\xa0 he went in therefore and shut the door upon them twain and prayed unto the lord\\xa0 and he went up and lay upon the child and put his mouth upon his mouth and his eyes upon his eyes and his hands upon his hands and he stretched himself upon him and the flesh of the child waxed warm\\xa0 then he returned and walked in the house once to and fro and went up and stretched himself upon him and the child sneezed seven times and the child opened his eyes\\xa0 and he called gehazi and said call this shunammite so he called her and when she was come in unto him he said take up thy son\\xa0 then she went in and fell at his feet and bowed down to the ground and she took up her son and went out \\xa0 and elisha came again to gilgal and there was a dearth in the land and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him and he said unto his servant set on the great pot and seethe pottage for the sons of the prophets\\xa0 and one went out into the field to gather herbs and found a wild vine and gathered thereof wild gourds his lap full and came and shred them into the pot of pottage for they knew them not\\xa0 so they poured out for the men to eat and it came to pass as they were eating of the pottage that they cried out and said o man of god there is death in the pot and they could not eat thereof\\xa0 but he said then bring meal and he cast it into the pot and he said pour out for the people that they may eat and there was no harm in the pot s\\xa0 and there came a man from baalshalishah and brought the man of god bread of the firstfruits twenty loaves of barley and fresh ears of corn in his sack and he said give unto the people that they may eat\\xa0 and his servant said how should i set this before a hundred men but he said give the people that they may eat for thus saith the lord they shall eat and shall leave thereof\\xa0 so he set it before them and they did eat and left thereof according to the word of the lord \\xa0 now naaman captain of the host of the king of aram was a great man with his master and held in esteem because by him the lord had given victory unto aram he was also a mighty man of valour but he was a leper\\xa0 and the arameans had gone out in bands and had brought away captive out of the land of israel a little maid and she waited on naamans wife\\xa0 and she said unto her mistress would that my lord were with the prophet that is in samaria then would he recover him of his leprosy\\xa0 and he went in and told his lord saying thus and thus said the maid that is of the land of israel\\xa0 and the king of aram said go now and i will send a letter unto the king of israel and he departed and took with him ten talents of silver and six thousand pieces of gold and ten changes of raiment\\xa0 and he brought the letter to the king of israel saying and now when this letter is come unto thee behold i have sent naaman my servant to thee that thou mayest recover him of his leprosy\\xa0 and it came to pass when the king of israel had read the letter that he rent his clothes and said am i god to kill and to make alive that this man doth send unto me to recover a man of his leprosy but consider i pray you and see how he seeketh an occasion against me\\xa0 and it was so when elisha the man of god heard that the king of israel had rent his clothes that he sent to the king saying wherefore hast thou rent thy clothes let him come now to me and he shall know that there is a prophet in israel\\xa0 so naaman came with his horses and with his chariots and stood at the door of the house of elisha\\xa0 and elisha sent a messenger unto him saying go and wash in the jordan seven times and thy flesh shall come back to thee and thou shalt be clean\\xa0 but naaman was wroth and went away and said behold i thought he will surely come out to me and stand and call on the name of the lord his god and wave his hand over the place and recover the leper\\xa0 are not amanah and pharpar the rivers of damascus better than all the waters of israel may i not wash in them and be clean so he turned and went away in a rage\\xa0 and his servants came near and spoke unto him and said my father if the prophet had bid thee do some great thing wouldest thou not have done it how much rather then when he saith to thee wash and be clean\\xa0 then went he down and dipped himself seven times in the jordan according to the saying of the man of god and his flesh came back like unto the flesh of a little child and he was clean\\xa0 and he returned to the man of god he and all his company and came and stood before him and he said behold now i know that there is no god in all the earth but in israel now therefore i pray thee take a present of thy servant\\xa0 but he said as the lord liveth before whom i stand i will receive none and he urged him to take it but he refused\\xa0 and naaman said if not yet i pray thee let there be given to thy servant two mules burden of earth for thy servant will henceforth offer neither burntoffering nor sacrifice unto other gods but unto the lord\\xa0 in this thing the lord pardon thy servant when my master goeth into the house of rimmon to worship there and he leaneth on my ha',\n",
       "  'nd and i prostrate myself in the house of rimmon when i prostrate myself in the house of rimmon the lord pardon thy servant in this thing\\xa0 and he said unto him go in peace so he departed from him some way s\\xa0 but gehazi the servant of elisha the man of god said behold my master hath spared this naaman the aramean in not receiving at his hands that which he brought as the lord liveth i will surely run after him and take somewhat of him\\xa0 so gehazi followed after naaman and when naaman saw one running after him he alighted from the chariot to meet him and said is all well\\xa0 and he said all is well my master hath sent me saying behold even now there are come to me from the hillcountry of ephraim two young men of the sons of the prophets give them i pray thee a talent of silver and two changes of raiment\\xa0 and naaman said be content take two talents and he urged him and bound two talents of silver in two bags with two changes of raiment and laid them upon two of his servants and they bore them before him\\xa0 and when he came to the hill he took them from their hand and deposited them in the house and he let the men go and they departed\\xa0 but he went in and stood before his master and elisha said unto him whence comest thou gehazi and he said thy servant went no whither\\xa0 and he said unto him went not my heart  when the man turned back from his chariot to meet thee is it a time to receive money and to receive garments and oliveyards and vineyards and sheep and oxen and menservants and maidservants\\xa0 the leprosy therefore of naaman shall cleave unto thee and unto thy seed for ever and he went out from his presence a leper as white as snow\\xa0 and the sons of the prophets said unto elisha behold now the place where we dwell before thee is too strait for us\\xa0 let us go we pray thee unto the jordan and take thence every man a beam and let us make us a place there where we may dwell and he answered go ye\\xa0 and one said be content i pray thee and go with thy servants and he answered i will go\\xa0 so he went with them and when they came to the jordan they cut down wood\\xa0 but as one was felling a beam the axehead fell into the water and he cried and said alas my master for it was borrowed\\xa0 and the man of god said where fell it and he showed him the place and he cut down a stick and cast it in thither and made the iron to swim\\xa0 and he said take it up to thee so he put out his hand and took it \\xa0 now the king of aram warred against israel and he took counsel with his servants saying in such and such a place shall be my camp\\xa0 and the man of god sent unto the king of israel saying beware that thou pass not such a place for thither the arameans are coming down\\xa0 and the king of israel sent to the place which the man of god told him and warned him of and he guarded himself there not once nor twice\\xa0 and the heart of the king of aram was sore troubled for this thing and he called his servants and said unto them will ye not tell me which of us is for the king of israel\\xa0 and one of his servants said nay my lord o king but elisha the prophet that is in israel telleth the king of israel the words that thou speakest in thy bedchamber\\xa0 and he said go and see where he is that i may send and fetch him and it was told him saying behold he is in dothan\\xa0 therefore sent he thither horses and chariots and a great host and they came by night and compassed the city about\\xa0 and when the servant of the man of god was risen early and gone forth behold a host with horses and chariots was round about the city and his servant said unto him alas my master how shall we do\\xa0 and he answered fear not for they that are with us are more than they that are with them\\xa0 and elisha prayed and said lord i pray thee open his eyes that he may see and the lord opened the eyes of the young man and he saw and behold the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about elisha\\xa0 and when they came down to him elisha prayed unto the lord and said smite this people i pray thee with blindness and he smote them with blindness according to the word of elisha\\xa0 and elisha said unto them this is not the way neither is this the city follow me and i will bring you to the man whom ye seek and he led them to samaria\\xa0 and it came to pass when they were come into samaria that elisha said lord open the eyes of these men that they may see and the lord opened their eyes and they saw and behold they were in the midst of samaria\\xa0 and the king of israel said unto elisha when he saw them my father shall i smite them shall i smite them\\xa0 and he answered thou shalt not smite them hast thou taken captive with thy sword and with thy bow those whom thou wouldest smite set bread and water before them that they may eat and drink and go to their master\\xa0 and he prepared great provision for them and when they had eaten and drunk he sent them away and they went to their master and the bands of aram came no more into the land of israel \\xa0 and it came to pass after this that benhadad king of aram gathered all his host and went up and besieged samaria\\xa0 and there was a great famine in samaria and behold they besieged it until an asss head was sold for fourscore pieces of silver and the fourth part of a kab of doves dung for five pieces of silver\\xa0 and as the king of israel was passing by upon the wall there cried a woman unto him saying help my lord o king\\xa0 and he said if the lord do not help thee whence shall i help thee out of the threshingfloor or out of the winepress\\xa0 and the king said unto her what aileth thee and she answered this woman said unto me give thy son that we may eat him today and we will eat my son tomorrow\\xa0 so we boiled my son and did eat him and i said unto her on the next day give thy son that we may eat him and she hath hid her son\\xa0 and it came to pass when the king heard the words of the woman that he rent his clothesnow he was passing by upon the walland the people looked and behold he had sackcloth within upon his flesh\\xa0 then he said god do so to me and more also if the head of elisha the son of shaphat shall stand on him this day\\xa0 but elisha sat in his house and the elders sat with him and the king sent a man from before him but ere the messenger came to him he said to the elders see ye how this son of a murderer hath sent to take away my head look when the messenger cometh shut the door and hold the door fast against him is not the sound of his masters feet behind him\\xa0 and while he yet talked with them behold the messenger came down unto him and  said behold this evil is of the lord why should i wait for the lord any longer \\xa0 and elisha said hear ye the word of the lord thus saith the lord tomorrow about this time shall a measure of fine flour be sold for a shekel and two measures of barley for a shekel in the gate of samaria\\xa0 then the captain on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of god and said behold if the lord should make windows in heaven might this thing be and he said behold thou shalt see it with thine eyes but shalt not eat thereof \\xa0 now there were four leprous men at the entrance of the gate and they said one to another why sit we here until we die\\xa0 if we say we will enter into the city then the famine is in the city and we shall die there and if we sit still here we die also now therefore come and let us fall unto the host of the arameans if they save us alive we shall live and if they kill us we shall but die\\xa0 and they rose up in the twilight to go unto the camp of the arameans and when they were come to the outermost part of the camp of the arameans behold there was no man there\\xa0 for the lord had made the host of the arameans to hear a noise of chariots and a noise of horses even the noise of a great host and they said one to another lo the king of israel hath hired against us the kings of the hittites and the kings of the egyptians to come upon us\\xa0 wherefore they arose and fled in the twilight and left their tents and their horses and their asses even the camp as it was and fled for their life\\xa0 and when these lepers came to the outermost part of the camp they went into one tent and did eat and drink and carried thence silver and gold and raiment and went and hid it and they came back and entered into another tent and carried thence also and went and hid it\\xa0 then they said one to another we do not well this day is a day of good tidings and we hold our peace if we tarry till the morning light punishment will overtake us now therefore come let us go and tell the kings household\\xa0 so they came and called unto the porters of the city and they told them saying we came to the camp of the arameans and behold there was no man there neither voice of man but the horses tied and the asses tied and the tents as they were\\xa0 and the porters called and they told it to the kings household within\\xa0 and the king arose in the night and said unto his servants i will now tell you what the arameans have done to us they know that we are hungry therefore are they gone out of the camp to hide themselves in the field saying when they come out of the city we shall take them alive and get into the city\\xa0 and one of his servants answered and said let some take i pray thee five of the horses that remain which are left in the citybehold they are as all the multitude of israel that are left in it behold they are as all the multitude of israel that are consumedand let us send and see\\xa0 they took therefore two chariots with horses and the king sent after the host of the arameans saying go and see\\xa0 and they went after them unto the jordan and lo all the way was full of garments and vessels which the arameans had cast away in their haste and the messengers returned and told the king\\xa0 and the people went out and spoiled the camp of the arameans so a measure of fine flour was sold for a shekel and two measures of barley for a shekel according to the word of the lord\\xa0 and the king appointed the captain on whose hand he leaned to have the charge of the gate and the people trod upon him in the gate and he died as the man of god had said who spoke when the king came down to him\\xa0 and it came to pass as the man of god had spoken to the king saying two measures of barley for a shekel and a measure of fine flour for a shekel shall be tomorrow about this time in the gate of samaria\\xa0 and that captain answered the man of god and said now behold if the lord should make windows in heaven might such a thing be and he said behold thou shalt see it with thine eyes but shalt not eat thereof\\xa0 it came to pass even so unto him for the people trod upon him in the gate and he died s\\xa0 now elisha had spoken unto the woman whose son he had restored to life saying arise and go thou and thy household and sojourn wheresoever thou canst sojourn for the lord hath called for a famine and it shall also come upon the land seven years\\xa0 and the woman arose and did according to the word of the man of god and she went with her household and sojourned in the land of the philistines seven years\\xa0 and it came to pass at the seven years end that the woman returned out of the land of the philistines and she went forth to cry unto the king for her house and for her land\\xa0 now the king was talking with gehazi the servant of the man of god saying tell me i pray thee all the great things that elisha hath done s\\xa0 and it came to pass as he was telling the king how he had restored to life him that was dead that behold the woman whose son he had restored to life cried to the king for her house and for her land and gehazi said my lord o king this is the woman and this is her son whom elisha restored to life\\xa0 and when the king asked the woman she told him so the king appointed unto her a certain officer saying restore all that was hers and all the fruits of the field since the day that she left the land even until now \\xa0 and elisha came to damascus and benhadad the king of aram was sick and it was told him saying the man of god is come hither\\xa0 and the king said unto hazael take a present in thy hand and go meet the man of god and inquire of the lord by him saying shall i recover of this sickness\\xa0 so hazael went to meet him and took a present with him even of ',\n",
       "  'every good thing of damascus forty camels burden and came and stood before him and said thy son benhadad king of aram hath sent me to thee saying shall i recover of this sickness\\xa0 and elisha said unto him go say unto him thou shalt surely recover howbeit the lord hath shown me that he shall surely die\\xa0 and he settled his countenance stedfastly upon him until he was ashamed and the man of god wept\\xa0 and hazael said why weepeth my lord and he answered because i know the evil that thou wilt do unto the children of israel their strongholds wilt thou set on fire and their young men wilt thou slay with the sword and wilt dash in pieces their little ones and rip up their women with child\\xa0 and hazael said but what is thy servant who is but a dog that he should do this great thing and elisha answered the lord hath shown me that thou shalt be king over aram\\xa0 then he departed from elisha and came to his master who said to him what said elisha to thee and he answered he told me that thou wouldest surely recover\\xa0 and it came to pass on the morrow that he took the coverlet and dipped it in water and spread it on his face so that he died and hazael reigned in his stead \\xa0 and in the fifth year of joram the son of ahab king of israel jehoshaphat being the king of judah jehoram the son of jehoshaphat king of judah began to reign\\xa0 thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign and he reigned eight years in jerusalem\\xa0 and he walked in the way of the kings of israel as did the house of ahab for he had the daughter of ahab to wife and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord\\xa0 howbeit the lord would not destroy judah for david his servants sake as he promised him to give unto him a lamp and to his children alway\\xa0 in his days edom revolted from under the hand of judah and made a king over themselves\\xa0 then joram passed over to zair and all his chariots with him and he rose up by night and smote the edomites that compassed him about and the captains of the chariots and the people fled to their tents\\xa0 yet edom revolted from under the hand of judah unto this day then did libnah revolt at the same time\\xa0 and the rest of the acts of joram and all that he did are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah\\xa0 and joram slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of david and ahaziah his son reigned in his stead \\xa0 in the twelfth year of joram the son of ahab king of israel did ahaziah the son of jehoram king of judah begin to reign\\xa0 two and twenty years old was ahaziah when he began to reign and he reigned one year in jerusalem and his mothers name was athaliah the daughter of omri king of israel\\xa0 and he walked in the way of the house of ahab and did that which was evil in the sight of the lord as did the house of ahab for he was the soninlaw of the house of ahab\\xa0 and he went with joram the son of ahab to war against hazael king of aram at ramothgilead and the arameans wounded joram\\xa0 and king joram returned to be healed in jezreel of the wounds which the arameans had given him at ramah when he fought against hazael king of aram and ahaziah the son of jehoram king of judah went down to see joram the son of ahab in jezreel because he was sick \\xa0 and elisha the prophet called one of the sons of the prophets and said unto him gird up thy loins and take this vial of oil in thy hand and go to ramothgilead\\xa0 and when thou comest thither look out there jehu the son of jehoshaphat the son of nimshi and go in and make him arise up from among his brethren and carry him to an inner chamber\\xa0 then take the vial of oil and pour it on his head and say thus saith the lord i have anointed thee king over israel then open the door and flee and tarry not\\xa0 so the young man even the young man the prophet went to ramothgilead\\xa0 and when he came behold the captains of the host were sitting and he said i have an errand to thee o captain and jehu said unto which of us all and he said to thee o captain\\xa0 and he arose and went into the house and he poured the oil on his head and said unto him thus saith the lord the god of israel i have anointed thee king over the people of the lord even over israel\\xa0 and thou shalt smite the house of ahab thy master that i may avenge the blood of my servants the prophets and the blood of all the servants of the lord at the hand of jezebel\\xa0 for the whole house of ahab shall perish and i will cut off from ahab every manchild and him that is shut up and him that is left at large in israel\\xa0 and i will make the house of ahab like the house of jeroboam the son of nebat and like the house of baasa the son of ahijah\\xa0 and the dogs shall eat jezebel in the portion of jezreel and there shall be none to bury her and he opened the door and fled\\xa0 then jehu came forth to the servants of his lord and one said unto him is all well wherefore came this mad fellow to thee and he said unto them ye know the man and what his talk was\\xa0 and they said it is false tell us now and he said thus and thus spoke he to me saying thus saith the lord i have anointed thee king over israel\\xa0 then they hastened and took every man his garment and put it under him on the top of the stairs and blew the horn saying jehu is king\\xa0 so jehu the son of jehoshaphat the son of nimshi conspired against joramnow joram had been guarding ramothgilead he and all israel because of hazael king of aram\\xa0 but king joram was returned to be healed in jezreel of the wounds which the arameans had given him when he fought with hazael king of aramand jehu said if this be your mind then let none escape and go forth out of the city to go to tell it in jezreel\\xa0 so jehu rode in a chariot and went to jezreel for joram lay there and ahaziah king of judah was come down to see joram\\xa0 now the watchman stood on the tower in jezreel and he spied the company of jehu as he came and said i see a company and joram said take a horseman and send to meet them and let him say is it peace\\xa0 so there went one on horseback to meet him and said thus saith the king is it peace and jehu said what hast thou to do with peace turn thee behind me and the watchman told saying the messenger came to them but he cometh not back\\xa0 then he sent out a second on horseback who came to them and said thus saith the king is it peace and jehu answered what hast thou to do with peace turn thee behind me\\xa0 and the watchman told saying he came even unto them and cometh not back and the driving is like the driving of jehu the son of nimshi for he driveth furiously\\xa0 and joram said make ready and they made ready his chariot and joram king of israel and ahaziah king of judah went out each in his chariot and they went out to meet jehu and found him in the portion of naboth the jezreelite\\xa0 and it came to pass when joram saw jehu that he said is it peace jehu and he answered what peace so long as the harlotries of thy mother jezebel and her witchcrafts are so many\\xa0 and joram turned his hands and fled and said to ahaziah there is treachery o ahaziah\\xa0 and jehu drew his bow with his full strength and smote joram between his arms and the arrow went out at his heart and he sunk down in his chariot\\xa0 then said  to bidkar his captain take up and cast him in the portion of the field of naboth the jezreelite for remember how that when i and thou rode together after ahab his father the lord pronounced this burden against him\\xa0 surely i have seen yesterday the blood of naboth and the blood of his sons saith the lord and i will requite thee in this plot saith the lord now therefore take and cast him into the plot of ground according to the word of the lord\\xa0 but when ahaziah the king of judah saw this he fled by the way of the gardenhouse and jehu followed after him and said smite him also in the chariot  at the ascent of gur which is by ibleam and he fled to megiddo and died there\\xa0 and his servants carried him in a chariot to jerusalem and buried him in his sepulchre with his fathers in the city of david \\xa0 and in the eleventh year of joram the son of ahab began ahaziah to reign over judah\\xa0 and when jehu was come to jezreel jezebel heard of it and she painted her eyes and attired her head and looked out at the window\\xa0 and as jehu entered in at the gate she said is it peace thou zimri thy masters murderer\\xa0 and he lifted up his face to the window and said who is on my side who and there looked out to him two or three officers\\xa0 and he said throw her down so they threw her down and some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall and on the horses and she was trodden under foot\\xa0 and when he was come in he did eat and drink and he said look now after this cursed woman and bury her for she is a kings daughter\\xa0 and they went to bury her but they found no more of her than the skull and the feet and the palms of her hands\\xa0 wherefore they came back and told him and he said this is the word of the lord which he spoke by his servant elijah the tishbite saying in the portion of jezreel shall the dogs eat the flesh of jezebel\\xa0 and the carcass of jezebel shall be as dung upon the face of the field in the portion of jezreel so that they shall not say this is jezebel s\\xa0 now ahab had seventy sons in samaria and jehu wrote letters and sent to samaria unto the rulers of jezreel even the elders and unto them that brought up  ahab saying\\xa0 and now as soon as this letter cometh to you seeing your masters sons are with you and there are with you chariots and horses fortified cities also and armour\\xa0 look ye out the best and meetest of your masters sons and set him on his fathers throne and fight for your masters house\\xa0 but they were exceedingly afraid and said behold the two kings stood not before him how then shall we stand\\xa0 and he that was over the household and he that was over the city the elders also and they that brought up the children sent to jehu saying we are thy servants and will do all that thou shalt bid us we will not make any man king do thou that which is good in thine eyes\\xa0 then he wrote a letter the second time to them saying if ye be on my side and if ye will hearken unto my voice take ye the heads of the men your masters sons and come to me to jezreel by tomorrow this time now the kings sons being seventy persons were with the great men of the city who brought them up\\xa0 and it came to pass when the letter came to them that they took the kings sons and slew them even seventy persons and put their heads in baskets and sent them unto him to jezreel\\xa0 and there came a messenger and told him saying they have brought the heads of the kings sons and he said lay ye them in two heaps at the entrance of the gate until the morning\\xa0 and it came to pass in the morning that he went out and stood and said to all the people ye are righteous behold i conspired against my master and slew him but who smote all these\\xa0 know now that there shall fall unto the earth nothing of the word of the lord which the lord spoke concerning the house of ahab for the lord hath done that which he spoke by his servant elijah\\xa0 so jehu smote all that remained of the house of ahab in jezreel and all his great men and his familiar friends and his priests until there was left him none remaining\\xa0 and he arose and departed and went to samaria and as he was at the shearinghouse of the shepherds in the way\\xa0 jehu met with the brethren of ahaziah king of judah and said who are ye and they answered we are the brethren of ahaziah and we go down to salute the children of the king and the children of the queen\\xa0 and he said take them alive and they took them alive and slew them at the pit of the shearinghouse even two and forty men neither left he any of them s\\xa0 and when he was departed thence he lighted on jehonadab the son of rechab coming to meet him and he saluted him and said to him is thy heart right as my heart is with thy heart and jehonadab answered it is if it be  give me thy hand and he gave him his hand and he took him up to him into the chariot\\xa0 and he said come with me and see my zeal for the lord so they made him ride in his chariot\\xa0 and when he came to samaria he smote all that remained unto ahab in samaria till he had destroyed him according to the word',\n",
       "  ' of the lord which he spoke to elijah \\xa0 and jehu gathered all the people together and said unto them ahab served baal a little but jehu will serve him much\\xa0 now therefore call unto me all the prophets of baal all his worshippers and all his priests let none be wanting for i have a great sacrifice to do to baal whosoever shall be wanting he shall not live but jehu did it in subtlety to the intent that he might destroy the worshippers of baal\\xa0 and jehu said sanctify a solemn assembly for baal and they proclaimed it\\xa0 and jehu sent through all israel and all the worshippers of baal came so that there was not a man left that came not and they came into the house of baal and the house of baal was filled from one end to another\\xa0 and he said unto him that was over the vestry bring forth vestments for all the worshippers of baal and he brought them forth vestments\\xa0 and jehu went and jehonadab the son of rechab into the house of baal and he said unto the worshippers of baal search and look that there be here with you none of the servants of the lord but the worshippers of baal only\\xa0 and they went in to offer sacrifices and burntofferings now jehu had appointed him fourscore men without and said if any of the men whom i bring into your hands escape his life shall be for the life of him\\xa0 and it came to pass as soon as he had made an end of offering the burntoffering that jehu said to the guard and to the captains go in and slay them let none come forth and they smote them with the edge of the sword and the guard and the captains cast them out and went to the city of the house of baal\\xa0 and they brought forth the pillars that were in the house of baal and burned them\\xa0 and they broke down the pillar of baal and broke down the house of baal and made it a draughthouse unto this day\\xa0 thus jehu destroyed baal out of israel\\xa0 howbeit from the sins of jeroboam the son of nebat wherewith he made israel to sin jehu departed not from after them the golden calves that were in bethel and that were in dan \\xa0 and the lord said unto jehu because thou hast done well in executing that which is right in mine eyes and hast done unto the house of ahab according to all that was in my heart thy sons of the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of israel\\xa0 but jehu took no heed to walk in the law of the lord the god of israel with all his heart he departed not from the sins of jeroboam wherewith he made israel to sin\\xa0 in those days the lord began to cut israel short and hazael smote them in all the borders of israel\\xa0 from the jordan eastward all the land of gilead the gadites and the reubenites and the manassites from aroer which is by the valley of arnon even gilead and bashan\\xa0 now the rest of the acts of jehu and all that he did and all his might are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel\\xa0 and jehu slept with his fathers and they buried him in samaria and jehoahaz his son reigned in his stead\\xa0 and the time that jehu reigned over israel in samaria was twenty and eight years \\xa0 now when athaliah the mother of ahaziah saw that her son was dead she arose and destroyed all the seed royal\\xa0 but jehosheba the daughter of king joram sister of ahaziah took joash the son of ahaziah and stole him away from among the kings sons that were slain even him and his nurse and put them in the bedchamber and they hid him from athaliah so that he was not slain\\xa0 and he was with her hid in the house of the lord six years and athaliah reigned over the land \\xa0 and in the seventh year jehoiada sent and fetched the captains over hundreds of the carites and of the guard and brought them to him into the house of the lord and he made a covenant with them and took an oath of them in the house of the lord and showed them the kings son\\xa0 and he commanded them saying this is the thing that ye shall do a third part of you that come in on the sabbath and that keep the watch of the kings house\\xa0 now another third part was at the gate sur and another third part at the gate behind the guardshall keep the watch of the house and be a barrier\\xa0 and the other two parts of you even all that go forth on the sabbath shall keep the watch of the house of the lord about the king\\xa0 and ye shall compass the king round about every man with his weapons in his hand and he that cometh within the ranks let him be slain and be ye with the king when he goeth out and when he cometh in\\xa0 and the captains over hundreds did according to all that jehoiada the priest commanded and they took every man his men those that were to come in on the sabbath with those that were to go out on the sabbath and came to jehoiada the priest\\xa0 and the priest delivered to the captains over hundreds the spear and shields that had been king davids which were in the house of the lord\\xa0 and the guard stood every man with his weapons in his hand from the right side of the house to the left side of the house along by the altar and the house by the king round about\\xa0 then he brought out the kings son and put upon him the crown and the insignia and they made him king and anointed him and they clapped their hands and said long live the king s\\xa0 and when athaliah heard the noise of the guard and of the people she came to the people into the house of the lord\\xa0 and she looked and behold the king stood on the platform as the manner was and the captains and the trumpets by the king and all the people of the land rejoiced and blew with trumpets then athaliah rent her clothes and cried treason treason\\xa0 and jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of hundreds the officers of the host and said unto them have her forth between the ranks and him that followeth her slay with the sword for the priest said let her not be slain in the house of the lord\\xa0 so they made way for her and she went by the way of the horses entry to the kings house and there was she slain s\\xa0 and jehoiada made a covenant between the lord and the king and the people that they should be the lords people between the king also and the people\\xa0 and all the people of the land went to the house of baal and broke it down his altars and his images broke they in pieces thoroughly and slew mattan the priest of baal before the altars and the priest appointed officers over the house of the lord\\xa0 and he took the captains over hundreds and the carites and the guard and all the people of the land and they brought down the king from the house of the lord and came by the way of the gate of the guard unto the kings house and he sat on the throne of the kings\\xa0 so all the people of the land rejoiced and the city was quiet and they slew athaliah with the sword at the kings house s\\xa0 jehoash was seven years old when he began to reign \\xa0 in the seventh year of jehu began jehoash to reign and he reigned forty years in jerusalem and his mothers name was zibiah of beersheba\\xa0 and jehoash did that which was right in the eyes of the lord all his days wherein jehoiada the priest instructed him\\xa0 howbeit the high places were not taken away the people still sacrificed and offered in the high places\\xa0 and jehoash said to the priests all the money of the hallowed things that is brought into the house of the lord in current money the money of the persons for whom each man is rated all the money that cometh into any mans heart to bring into the house of the lord\\xa0 let the priests take it to them every man from him that bestoweth it upon him and they shall repair the breaches of the house wheresoever any breach shall be found \\xa0 but it was so that in the three and twentieth year of king jehoash the priests had not repaired the breaches of the house\\xa0 then king jehoash called for jehoiada the priest and for the other priests and said unto them why repair ye not the breaches of the house now therefore take no longer money from them that bestow it upon you but deliver it for the breaches of the house\\xa0 and the priests consented that they should take no longer money from the people neither repair the breaches of the house\\xa0 and jehoiada the priest took a chest and bored a hole in the lid of it and set it beside the altar on the right side as one cometh into the house of the lord and the priests that kept the threshold put therein all the money that was brought into the house of the lord\\xa0 and it was so when they saw that there was much money in the chest that the kings scribe and the high priest came up and they put up in bags and counted the money that was found in the house of the lord\\xa0 and they gave the money that was weighed out into the hands of them that did the work that had the oversight of the house of the lord and they paid it out to the carpenters and the builders that wrought upon the house of the lord\\xa0 and to the masons and the hewers of stone and for buying timber and hewn stone to repair the breaches of the house of the lord and for all that was laid out for the house to repair it\\xa0 but there were not made for the house of the lord cups of silver snuffers basins trumpets any vessels of gold or vessels of silver of the money that was brought into the house of the lord\\xa0 for they gave that to them that did the work and repaired therewith the house of the lord\\xa0 moreover they reckoned not with the men into whose hand they delivered the money to give to them that did the work for they dealt faithfully\\xa0 the forfeit money and the sin money was not brought into the house of the lord it was the priests \\xa0 then hazael king of aram went up and fought against gath and took it and hazael set his face to go up to jerusalem\\xa0 and jehoash king judah took all the hallowed things that jehoshaphat and jehoram and ahaziah his fathers kings of judah had dedicated and his own hallowed things and all the gold that was found in the treasures of the house of the lord and of the kings house and sent it to hazael king of aram and he went away from jerusalem\\xa0 now the rest of the acts of joash and all that he did are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah\\xa0 and his servants arose and made a conspiracy and smote joash at bethmillo on the way that goeth down to silla\\xa0 for jozacar the son of shimeath and jehozabad the son of shomer his servants smote him and he died and they buried him with his fathers in the city of david and amaziah his son reigned in his stead \\xa0 in the three and twentieth year of joash the son of ahaziah king of judah jehoahaz the son of jehu began to reign over israel in samaria and reigned seventeen years\\xa0 and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord and followed the sins of jeroboam the son of nebat wherewith he made israel to sin he departed not therefrom\\xa0 and the anger of the lord was kindled against israel and he delivered them into the hand of hazael king of aram and into the hand of benhadad the son of hazael continually\\xa0 and jehoahaz besought the lord and the lord hearkened unto him for he saw the oppression of israel how that the king of aram oppressed them\\xa0 and the lord gave israel a deliverer so that they went out from under the hand of the arameans and the children of israel dwelt in their tents as beforetime\\xa0 nevertheless they departed not from the sins of the house of jeroboam wherewith he made israel to sin but walked therein and there remained the asherah also in samaria\\xa0 for there was not left to jehoahaz of the people save fifty horsemen and ten chariots and ten thousand footmen for the king of aram destroyed them and made them like the dust in threshing\\xa0 now the rest of the acts of jehoahaz and all that he did and his might are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel\\xa0 and jehoahaz slept with his fathers and they buried him in samaria and joash his son reigned in his stead \\xa0 in the thirty and seventh year of joash king of judah began jehoash the son of jehoahaz to reign over israel in samaria and reigned sixteen years\\xa0 and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord he departed not from all the sins of jeroboam the son of nebat wherewith he made israel to sin but he walked

are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel \\xa0 in the second year of pekah the son of remaliah king of israel began jotham the son of uzziah king of judah to reign\\xa0 five and twenty years old was he when he began to reign and he reigned sixteen years in jerusalem and his mothers name was jerusha the daughter of zadok\\xa0 and he did that which was right in the eyes of the lord he did according to all that his father uzziah had done\\xa0 howbeit the high places were not taken away the people still sacrificed and offered in the high places he built the upper gate of the house of the lord\\xa0 now the rest of the acts of jotham and all that he did are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah\\xa0 in those days the lord began to send against judah rezin the king of aram and pekah the son of remaliah\\xa0 and jotham slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of david his fa',\n",
       "  'ther and ahaz his son reigned in his stead \\xa0 in the seventeenth year of pekah the son of remaliah ahaz the son of jotham king of judah began to reign\\xa0 twenty years old was ahaz when he began to reign and he reigned sixteen years in jerusalem and he did not that which was right in the eyes of the lord his god like david his father\\xa0 but he walked in the way of the kings of israel yea and made his son to pass through the fire according to the abominations of the heathen whom the lord cast out from before the children of israel\\xa0 and he sacrificed and offered in the high places and on the hills and under every leafy tree\\xa0 then rezin king of aram and pekah son of remaliah king of israel came up to jerusalem to war and they besieged ahaz but could not overcome him\\xa0 at that time rezin king of aram recovered elath to aram and drove the jews from elath and the edomites came to elath and dwelt there unto this day \\xa0 so ahaz sent messengers to tiglathpileser king of assyria saying i am thy servant and thy son come up and save me out of the hand of the king of aram and out of the hand of the king of israel who rise up against me\\xa0 and ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of the lord and in the treasures of the kings house and sent it for a present to the king of assyria\\xa0 and the king of assyria hearkened unto him and the king of assyria went up against damascus and took it and carried the people of it captive to kir and slew rezin\\xa0 and king ahaz went to damascus to meet tiglathpileser king of assyria and saw the altar that was at damascus and king ahaz sent to urijah the priest the fashion of the altar and the pattern of it according to all the workmanship thereof\\xa0 and urijah the priest built an altar according to all that king ahaz had sent from damascus so did urijah the priest make it against the coming of king ahaz from damascus\\xa0 and when the king was come from damascus the king saw the altar and the king drew near unto the altar and offered thereon\\xa0 and he offered his burntoffering and his mealoffering and poured his drinkoffering and dashed the blood of his peaceofferings against the altar\\xa0 and the brazen altar which was before the lord he brought from the forefront of the house from between his altar and the house of the lord and put it on the north side of his altar\\xa0 and king ahaz commanded urijah the priest saying upon the great altar offer the morning burntoffering and the evening mealoffering and the kings burntoffering and his mealoffering with the burntoffering of all the people of the land and their mealoffering and their drinkofferings and dash against it all the blood of the burntoffering and all the blood of the sacrifice but the brazen altar shall be for me to look to\\xa0 thus did urijah the priest according to all that king ahaz commanded\\xa0 and king ahaz cut off the borders of the bases and removed the laver from off them and took down the sea from off the brazen oxen that were under it and put it upon a pavement of stone\\xa0 and the covered place for the sabbath that they had built in the house and the kings entry without turned he unto the house of the lord because of the king of assyria\\xa0 now the rest of the acts of ahaz which he did are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah\\xa0 and ahaz slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of david and hezekiah his son reigned in his stead \\xa0 in the twelfth year of ahaz king of judah began hoshea the son of elah to reign in samaria over israel and reigned nine years\\xa0 and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord yet not as the kings of israel that were before him\\xa0 against him came up shalmaneser king of assyria and hoshea became his servant and brought him presents\\xa0 and the king of assyria found conspiracy in hoshea for he had sent messengers to so king of egypt and offered no present to the king of assyria as he had done year by year therefore the king of assyria shut him up and bound him in prison\\xa0 then the king of assyria came up throughout all the land and went up to samaria and besieged it three years\\xa0 in the ninth year of hoshea the king of assyria took samaria and carried israel away unto assyria and placed them in halah and in habor on the river of gozan and in the cities of the medes \\xa0 and it was so because the children of israel had sinned against the lord their god who brought them up out of the land of egypt from under the hand of pharaoh king of egypt and had feared other gods\\xa0 and walked in the statutes of the nations whom the lord cast out from before the children of israel and of the kings of israel which they practised\\xa0 and the children of israel did impute things that were not right unto the lord their god and they built them high places in all their cities from the tower of the watchmen to the fortified city\\xa0 and they set them up pillars and asherim upon every high hill and under every leafy tree\\xa0 and there they offered in all the high places as did the nations whom the lord carried away before them and wrought wicked things to provoke the lord\\xa0 and they served idols whereof the lord had said unto them ye shall not do this thing\\xa0 yet the lord forewarned israel and judah by the hand of every prophet and of every seer saying turn ye from your evil ways and keep my commandments and my statutes according to all the law which i commanded your fathers and which i sent to you by the hand of my servants the prophets\\xa0 notwithstanding they would not hear but hardened their neck like to the neck of their fathers who believed not in the lord their god\\xa0 and they rejected his statutes and his covenant that he made with their fathers and his testimonies wherewith he testified against them and they went after things of nought and became nought and after the nations that were round about them concerning whom the lord had charged them that they should not do like them\\xa0 and they forsook all the commandments of the lord their god and made them molten images even two calves and made an asherah and worshipped all the host of heaven and served baal\\xa0 and they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire and used divination and enchantments and gave themselves over to do that which was evil in the sight of the lord to provoke him\\xa0 that the lord was very angry with israel and removed them out of his sight there was none left but the tribe of judah only\\xa0 also judah kept not the commandments of the lord their god but walked in the statutes of israel which they practised\\xa0 and the lord rejected all the seed of israel and afflicted them and delivered them into the hand of spoilers until he had cast them out of his sight\\xa0 for he rent israel from the house of david and they made jeroboam the son of nebat king and jeroboam drew israel away from following the lord and made them sin a great sin\\xa0 and the children of israel walked in all the sins of jeroboam which he did they departed not from them\\xa0 until the lord removed israel out of his sight as he spoke by the hand of all his servants the prophets so israel was carried away out of their own land to assyria unto this day \\xa0 and the king of assyria brought men from babylon and from cuthah and from avva and from hamath and sepharvaim and placed them in the cities of samaria instead of the children of israel and they possessed samaria and dwelt in the cities thereof\\xa0 and so it was at the beginning of their dwelling there that they feared not the lord therefore the lord sent lions among them which killed some of them\\xa0 wherefore they spoke to the king of assyria saying the nations which thou hast carried away and placed in the cities of samaria know not the manner of the god of the land therefore he hath sent lions among them and behold they slay them because they know not the manner of the god of the land\\xa0 then the king of assyria commanded saying carry thither one of the priests whom ye brought from thence and let them go and dwell there and let him teach them the manner of the god of the land\\xa0 so one of the priests whom they had carried away from samaria came and dwelt in bethel and taught them how they should fear the lord\\xa0 howbeit every nation made gods of their own and put them in the houses of the high places which the samaritans had made every nation in their cities wherein they dwelt\\xa0 and the men of babylon made succothbenoth and the men of cuth made nergal and the men of hamath made ashima\\xa0 and the avvites made nibhaz and tartak and the sepharvites burnt their children in the fire to adrammelech and anammelech the gods of sepharvaim\\xa0 so they feared the lord and made unto them from among themselves priests of the high places who sacrificed for them in the houses of the high places\\xa0 they feared the lord and served their own gods after the manner of the nations from among whom they had been carried away\\xa0 unto this day they do after the former manners they fear not the lord neither do they after their statutes or after their ordinances or after the law or after the commandment which the lord commanded the children of jacob whom he named israel\\xa0 with whom the lord had made a covenant and charged them saying ye shall not fear other gods nor bow down to them nor serve them nor sacrifice to them\\xa0 but the lord who brought you up out of the land of egypt with great power and with an outstretched arm him shall ye fear and him shall ye worship and to him shall ye sacrifice\\xa0 and the statutes and the ordinances and the law and the commandment which he wrote for you ye shall observe to do for evermore and ye shall not fear other gods\\xa0 and the covenant that i have made with you ye shall not forget neither shall ye fear other gods\\xa0 but the lord your god shall ye fear and he will deliver you out of the hand of all your enemies\\xa0 howbeit they did not hearken but they did after their former manner\\xa0 so these nations feared the lord and served their graven images their children likewise and their childrens children as did their fathers so do they unto this day \\xa0 now it came to pass in the third year of hoshea son of elah king of israel that hezekiah the son of ahaz king of judah began to reign\\xa0 twenty and five years old was he when he began to reign and he reigned twenty and nine years in jerusalem and his mothers name was abi the daughter of zechariah\\xa0 and he did that which was right in the eyes of the lord according to all that david his father had done\\xa0 he removed the high places and broke the pillars and cut down the asherah and he broke in pieces the brazen serpent that moses had made for unto those days the children of israel did offer to it and it was called nehushtan\\xa0 he trusted in the lord the god of israel so that after him was none like him among all the kings of judah nor among them that were before him\\xa0 for he cleaved to the lord he departed not from following him but kept his commandments which the lord commanded moses\\xa0 and the lord was with him whithersoever he went forth he prospered and he rebelled against the king of assyria and served him not\\xa0 he smote the philistines unto gaza and the borders thereof from the tower of the watchmen to the fortified city \\xa0 and it came to pass in the fourth year of king hezekiah which was the seventh year of hoshea son of elah king of israel that shalmaneser king of assyria came up against samaria and besieged it\\xa0 and at the end of three years they took it even in the sixth year of hezekiah which was the ninth year of hoshea king of israel samaria was taken\\xa0 and the king of assyria carried israel away unto assyria and put them in halah and in habor on the river of gozan and in the cities of the medes\\xa0 because they hearkened not to the voice of the lord their god but transgressed his covenant even all that moses the servant of the lord commanded and would not hear it nor do it \\xa0 now in the fourteenth year of king hezekiah did sennacherib king of assyria come up against all the fortified cities of judah and took them\\xa0 and hezekiah king of judah sent to the king of assyria to lachish saying i have offended return from me that which thou puttest on me will i bear and the king of assyria appointed unto h',\n",
       "  'ezekiah king of judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold\\xa0 and hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in the house of the lord and in the treasures of the kings house\\xa0 at that time did hezekiah cut off the gold from the doors of the temple of the lord and from the doorposts which hezekiah king of judah had overlaid and gave it to the king of assyria \\xa0 and the king of assyria sent tartan and rabsaris and rabshakeh from lachish to king hezekiah with a great army unto jerusalem and they went up and came to jerusalem and when they were come up they came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool which is in the highway of the fullers field\\xa0 and when they had called to the king there came out to them eliakim the son of hilkiah who was over the household and shebnah the scribe and joah the son of asaph the recorder\\xa0 and rabshakeh said unto them say ye now to hezekiah thus saith the great king the king of assyria what confidence is this wherein thou trustest\\xa0 sayest thou that a mere word of the lips is counsel and strength for the war now on whom dost thou trust that thou hast rebelled against me\\xa0 now behold thou trustest upon the staff of this bruised reed even upon egypt whereon if a man lean it will go into his hand and pierce it so is pharaoh king of egypt unto all that trust on him\\xa0 but if ye say unto me we trust in the lord our god is not that he whose high places and whose altars hezekiah hath taken away and hath said to judah and to jerusalem ye shall worship before this altar in jerusalem\\xa0 now therefore i pray thee make a wager with my master the king of assyria and i will give thee two thousand horses if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them\\xa0 how then canst thou turn away the face of one captain even of the least of my masters servants and yet thou puttest thy trust on egypt for chariots and for horsemen\\xa0 am i now come up without the lord against this place to destroy it the lord said unto me go up against this land destroy it\\xa0 then said eliakim the son of hilkiah and shebnah and joah unto rabshakeh speak i pray thee to thy servants in the aramean language for we understand it and speak not with us in the jews language in the ears of the people that are on the wall\\xa0 but rabshakeh said unto them hath my master sent me to thy master and to thee to speak these words hath he not sent me to the men that sit on the wall to eat their own dung and to drink their own water with you\\xa0 then rabshakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in the jews language and spoke saying hear ye the word of the great king the king of assyria\\xa0 thus saith the king let not hezekiah beguile you for he will not be able to deliver you out of his hand\\xa0 neither let hezekiah make you trust in the lord saying the lord will surely deliver us and this city shall not be given into the hand of the king of assyria\\xa0 hearken not to hezekiah for thus saith the king of assyria make your peace with me and come out to me and eat ye every one of his vine and every one of his figtree and drink ye every one the waters of his own cistern\\xa0 until i come and take you away to a land like your own land a land of corn and wine a land of bread and vineyards a land of olivetrees and of honey that ye may live and not die and hearken not unto hezekiah when he persuadeth you saying the lord will deliver us\\xa0 hath any of the gods of the nations ever delivered his land out of the hand of the king of assyria\\xa0 where are the gods of hamath and of arpad where are the gods of sepharvaim of hena and ivvah have they delivered samaria out of my hand\\xa0 who are they among all the gods of the countries that have delivered their country out of my hand that the lord should deliver jerusalem out of my hand\\xa0 but the people held their peace and answered him not a word for the kings commandment was saying answer him not\\xa0 then came eliakim the son of hilkiah who was over the household and shebna the scribe and joah the son of asaph the recorder to hezekiah with their clothes rent and told him the words of rabshakeh\\xa0 and it came to pass when king hezekiah heard it that he rent his clothes and covered himself with sackcloth and went into the house of the lord\\xa0 and he sent eliakim who was over the household and shebna the scribe and the elders of the priests covered with sackcloth unto isaiah the prophet the son of amoz\\xa0 and they said unto him thus saith hezekiah this day is a day of trouble and of rebuke and of contumely for the children are come to the birth and there is not strength to bring forth\\xa0 it may be the lord thy god will hear all the words of rabshakeh whom the king of assyria his master hath sent to taunt the living god and will rebuke the words which the lord thy god hath heard wherefore make prayer for the remnant that is left\\xa0 so the servants of king hezekiah came to isaiah\\xa0 and isaiah said unto them thus shall ye say to your master thus saith the lord be not afraid of the words that thou hast heard wherewith the servants of the king of assyria have blasphemed me\\xa0 behold i will put a spirit in him and he shall hear a rumour and shall return to his own land and i will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land\\xa0 so rabshakeh returned and found the king of assyria warring against libnah for he had heard that he was departed from lachish\\xa0 and when he heard say of tirhakah king of ethiopia behold he is come out to fight against thee he sent messengers again unto hezekiah saying\\xa0 thus shall ye speak to hezekiah king of judah saying let not thy god in whom thou trustest beguile thee saying jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of assyria\\xa0 behold thou hast heard what the kings of assyria have done to all lands by destroying them utterly and shalt thou be delivered\\xa0 have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed gozan and haran and rezeph and the children of eden that were in telassar\\xa0 where is the king of hamath and the king of arpad and the king of the city of sepharvaim of hena and ivvah\\xa0 and hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers and read it and hezekiah went up unto the house of the lord and spread it before the lord \\xa0 and hezekiah prayed before the lord and said o lord the god of israel that sittest upon the cherubim thou art the god even thou alone of all the kingdoms of the earth thou hast made heaven and earth\\xa0 incline thine ear o lord and hear open thine eyes o lord and see and hear the words of sennacherib wherewith he hath sent him to taunt the living god\\xa0 of a truth lord the kings of assyria have laid waste the nations and their lands\\xa0 and have cast their gods into the fire for they were no gods but the work of mens hands wood and stone therefore they have destroyed them\\xa0 now therefore o lord our god save thou us i beseech thee out of his hand that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the lord god even thou only s\\xa0 then isaiah the son of amoz sent to hezekiah saying thus saith the lord the god of israel whereas thou hast prayed to me against sennacherib king of assyria i have heard thee\\xa0 this is the word that the lord hath spoken concerning him the virgin daughter of zion hath despised thee and laughed thee to scorn the daughter of jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee\\xa0 whom hast thou taunted and blasphemed and against whom hast thou exalted thy voice yea thou hast lifted up thine eyes on high even against the holy one of israel\\xa0 by the messengers thou hast taunted the lord and hast said with the multitude of my chariots am i come up to the height of the mountains to the innermost parts of lebanon and i have cut down the tall cedars thereof and the choice cypresses thereof and i have entered into his farthest lodge the forest of his fruitful field\\xa0 i have digged and drunk strange waters and with the sole of my feet have i dried up all the rivers of egypt\\xa0 hast thou not heard long ago i made it in ancient times i fashioned it now have i brought it to pass yea it is done that fortified cities should be laid waste into ruinous heaps\\xa0 therefore their inhabitants were of small power they were dismayed and confounded they were as the grass of the field and as the green herb as the grass on the housetops and as corn blasted before it is grown up\\xa0 but i know thy sitting down and thy going out and thy coming in and thy raging against me\\xa0 because of thy raging against me and for that thy tumult is come up into mine ears therefore will i put my hook in thy nose and my bridle in thy lips and i will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest\\xa0 and this shall be the sign unto thee ye shall eat this year that which groweth of itself and in the second year that which springeth of the same and in the third year sow ye and reap and plant vineyards and eat the fruit thereof\\xa0 and the remnant that is escaped of the house of judah shall again take root downward and bear fruit upward\\xa0 for out of jerusalem shall go forth a remnant and out of mount zion they that shall escape the zeal of the lord of hosts shall perform this s\\xa0 therefore thus saith the lord concerning the king of assyria he shall not come unto this city nor shoot an arrow there neither shall he come before it with shield nor cast a mound against it\\xa0 by the way that he came by the same shall he return and he shall not come unto this city saith the lord\\xa0 for i will defend this city to save it for mine own sake and for my servant davids sake\\xa0 and it came to pass that night that the angel of the lord went forth and smote in the camp of the assyrians a hundred fourscore and five thousand and when men arose early in the morning behold they were all dead corpses\\xa0 so sennacherib king of assyria departed and went and returned and dwelt at nineveh\\xa0 and it came to pass as he was worshipping in the house of nisroch his god that adrammelech and sarezer his sons smote him with the sword and they escaped into the land of ararat and esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead \\xa0 in those days was hezekiah sick unto death and isaiah the prophet the son of amoz came to him and said unto him thus saith the lord set thy house in order for thou shalt die and not live\\xa0 then he turned his face to the wall and prayed unto the lord saying\\xa0 remember now o lord i beseech thee how i have walked before thee in truth and with a whole heart and have done that which is good in thy sight and hezekiah wept sore s\\xa0 and it came to pass before isaiah was gone out of the inner court of the city that the word of the lord came to him saying\\xa0 return and say to hezekiah the prince of my people thus saith the lord the god of david thy father i have heard thy prayer i have seen thy tears behold i will heal thee on the third day thou shalt go up unto the house of the lord\\xa0 and i will add unto thy days fifteen years and i will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of assyria and i will defend this city for mine own sake and for my servant davids sake\\xa0 and isaiah said take a cake of figs and they took and laid it on the boil and he recovered\\xa0 and hezekiah said unto isaiah what shall be the sign that the lord will heal me and that i shall go up unto the house of the lord the third day\\xa0 and isaiah said this shall be the sign unto thee from the lord that the lord will do the thing that he hath spoken shall the shadow go forward ten degrees or go back ten degrees\\xa0 and hezekiah answered it is a light thing for the shadow to decline ten degrees nay but let the shadow return backward ten degrees\\xa0 and isaiah the prophet cried unto the lord and he brought the shadow ten degrees backward by which it had gone down on the dial of ahaz \\xa0 at that time berodachbaladan the son of baladan king of babylon sent a letter and a present unto hezekiah for he had heard that hezekiah had been sick\\xa0 and hezekiah hearkened unto them and showed them all his treasurehouse the silver and the gold and the spices and the precious oil and the house of his armour and all that was found in his treasures there was nothing in his house nor in all his dominion that hezekiah showed them not\\xa0 then came isaiah the prophet unto king hezekiah and said unto him what said ',\n",
       "  'these men and from whence came they unto thee and hezekiah said they are come from a far country even from babylon\\xa0 and he said what have they seen in thy house and hezekiah answered all that is in my house have they seen there is nothing among my treasures that i have not shown them\\xa0 and isaiah said unto hezekiah hear the word of the lord\\xa0 behold the days come that all that is in thy house and that which thy fathers have laid up in store unto this day shall be carried to babylon nothing shall be left saith the lord\\xa0 and of thy sons that shall issue from thee whom thou shalt beget shall they take away and they shall be officers in the palace of the king of babylon\\xa0 then said hezekiah unto isaiah good is the word of the lord which thou hast spoken he said moreover is it not so if peace and truth shall be in my days\\xa0 now the rest of the acts of hezekiah and all his might and how he made the pool and the conduit and brought water into the city are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah\\xa0 and hezekiah slept with his fathers and manasseh his son reigned in his stead \\xa0 manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign and he reigned five and fifty years in jerusalem and his mothers name was hephzibah\\xa0 and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord after the abominations of the nations whom the lord cast out before the children of israel\\xa0 for he built again the high places which hezekiah his father had destroyed and he reared up altars for baal and made an asherah as did ahab king of israel and worshipped all the host of heaven and served them\\xa0 and he built altars in the house of the lord whereof the lord said in jerusalem will i put my name\\xa0 and he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the lord\\xa0 and he made his son to pass through the fire and practised soothsaying and used enchantments and appointed them that divined by a ghost or a familiar spirit he wrought much evil in the sight of the lord to provoke him\\xa0 and he set the graven image of asherah that he had made in the house of which the lord said to david and to solomon his son in this house and in jerusalem which i have chosen out of all the tribes of israel will i put my name for ever\\xa0 neither will i cause the feet of israel to wander any more out of the land which i gave their fathers if only they will observe to do according to all that i have commanded them and according to all the law that my servant moses commanded them\\xa0 but they hearkened not and manasseh seduced them to do that which is evil more than did the nations whom the lord destroyed before the children of israel\\xa0 and the lord spoke by his servants the prophets saying\\xa0 because manasseh king of judah hath done these abominations and hath done wickedly above all that the amorites did that were before him and hath made judah also to sin with his idols s\\xa0 therefore thus saith the lord the god of israel behold i bring such evil upon jerusalem and judah that whosoever heareth of it both his ears shall tingle\\xa0 and i will stretch over jerusalem the line of samaria and the plummet of the house of ahab and i will wipe jerusalem as a man wipeth a dish wiping it and turning it upside down\\xa0 and i will cast off the remnant of mine inheritance and deliver them into the hand of their enemies and they shall become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies\\xa0 because they have done that which is evil in my sight and have provoked me since the day their fathers came forth out of egypt even unto this day\\xa0 moreover manasseh shed innocent blood very much till he had filled jerusalem from one end to another beside his sin wherewith he made judah to sin in doing that which was evil in the sight of the lord\\xa0 now the rest of the acts of manasseh and all that he did and his sin that he sinned are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah\\xa0 and manasseh slept with his fathers and was buried in the garden of his own house in the garden of uzza and amon his son reigned in his stead \\xa0 amon was twenty and two years old when he began to reign and he reigned two years in jerusalem and his mothers name was meshullemeth the daughter of haruz of jotbah\\xa0 and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord as did manasseh his father\\xa0 and he walked in all the way that his father walked in and served the idols that his father served and worshipped them\\xa0 and he forsook the lord the god of his fathers and walked not in the way of the lord\\xa0 and the servants of amon conspired against him and put the king to death in his own house\\xa0 but the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king amon and the people of the land made josiah his son king in his stead\\xa0 now the rest of the acts of amon which he did are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah\\xa0 and he was buried in his sepulchre in the garden of uzza and josiah his son reigned in his stead \\xa0 josiah was eight years old when he began to reign and he reigned thirty and one years in jerusalem and his mothers name was jedidah the daughter of adaiah of bozkath\\xa0 and he did that which was right in the eyes of the lord and walked in all the way of david his father and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left \\xa0 and it came to pass in the eighteenth year of king josiah that the king sent shaphan the son of azaliah the son of meshullam the scribe to the house of the lord saying\\xa0 go up to hilkiah the high priest that he may sum the money which is brought into the house of the lord which the keepers of the door have gathered of the people\\xa0 and let them deliver it into the hand of the workmen that have the oversight of the house of the lord and let them give it to the workmen that are in the house of the lord to repair the breaches of the house\\xa0 unto the carpenters and to the builders and to the masons and for buying timber and hewn stone to repair the house\\xa0 howbeit there was no reckoning made with them of the money that was delivered into their hand for they dealt faithfully\\xa0 and hilkiah the high priest said unto shaphan the scribe i have found the book of the law in the house of the lord and hilkiah delivered the book to shaphan and he read it\\xa0 and shaphan the scribe came to the king and brought back word unto the king and said thy servants have poured out the money that was found in the house and have delivered it into the hand of the workmen that have the oversight of the house of the lord\\xa0 and shaphan the scribe told the king saying hilkiah the priest hath delivered me a book and shaphan read it before the king\\xa0 and it came to pass when the king had heard the words of the book of the law that he rent his clothes\\xa0 and the king commanded hilkiah the priest and ahikam the son of shaphan and achbor the son of micaiah and shaphan the scribe and asaiah the kings servant saying\\xa0 go ye inquire of the lord for me and for the people and for all judah concerning the words of this book that is found for great is the wrath of the lord that is kindled against us because our fathers have not hearkened unto the words of this book to do according unto all that which is written concerning us\\xa0 so hilkiah the priest and ahikam and achbor and shaphan and asaiah went unto huldah the prophetess the wife of shallum the son of tikvah the son of harhas keeper of the wardrobenow she dwelt in jerusalem in the second quarterand they spoke with her\\xa0 and she said unto them thus saith the lord the god of israel tell ye the man that sent you unto me\\xa0 thus saith the lord behold i will bring evil upon this place and upon the inhabitants thereof even all the words of the book which the king of judah hath read\\xa0 because they have forsaken me and have offered unto other gods that they might provoke me with all the work of their hands therefore my wrath shall be kindled against this place and it shall not be quenched\\xa0 but unto the king of judah who sent you to inquire of the lord thus shall ye say to him thus saith the lord the god of israel as touching the words which thou hast heard\\xa0 because thy heart was tender and thou didst humble thyself before the lord when thou heardest what i spoke against this place and against the inhabitants thereof that they should become an astonishment and a curse and hast rent thy clothes and wept before me i also have heard thee saith the lord\\xa0 therefore behold i will gather thee to thy fathers and thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace neither shall thine eyes see all the evil which i will bring upon this place and they brought back word unto the king\\xa0 and the king sent and they gathered unto him all the elders of judah and of jerusalem\\xa0 and the king went up to the house of the lord and all the men of judah and all the inhabitants of jerusalem with him and the priests and the prophets and all the people both small and great and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant which was found in the house of the lord\\xa0 and the king stood on the platform and made a covenant before the lord to walk after the lord and to keep his commandments and his testimonies and his statutes with all his heart and all his soul to confirm the words of this covenant that were written in this book and all the people stood to the covenant\\xa0 and the king commanded hilkiah the high priest and the priests of the second order and the keepers of the door to bring forth out of the temple of the lord all the vessels that were made for baal and for the asherah and for all the host of heaven and he burned them without jerusalem in the fields of kidron and carried the ashes of them unto bethel\\xa0 and he put down the idolatrous priests whom the kings of judah had ordained to offer in the high places in the cities of judah and in the places round about jerusalem them also that offered unto baal to the sun and to the moon and to the constellations and to all the host of heaven\\xa0 and he brought out the asherah from the house of the lord without jerusalem unto the brook kidron and burned it at the brook kidron and stamped it small to powder and cast the powder thereof upon the graves of the common people\\xa0 and he broke down the houses of the sodomites that were in the house of the lord where the women wove coverings for the asherah\\xa0 and he brought all the priests out of the cities of judah and defiled the high places where the priests had made offerings from geba to beersheba and he broke down the high places of the gates that were at the entrance of the gate of joshua the governor of the city which were on a mans left hand as he entered the gate of the city\\xa0 nevertheless the priests of the high places came not up to the altar of the lord in jerusalem but they did eat unleavened bread among their brethren\\xa0 and he defiled topheth which is in the valley of the son of hinnom that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to molech\\xa0 and he took away the horses that the kings of judah had given to the sun at the entrance of the house of the lord by the chamber of nethanmelech the officer which was in the precincts and he burned the chariots of the sun with fire\\xa0 and the altars that were on the roof of the upper chamber of ahaz which the kings of judah had made and the altars which manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of the lord did the king break down and beat them down from thence and cast the dust of them into the brook kidron\\xa0 and the high places that were before jerusalem which were on the right hand of the mount of corruption which solomon the king of israel had builded for ashtoreth the detestation of the zidonians and for chemosh the detestation of moab and for milcom the abomination of the children of ammon did the king defile\\xa0 and he broke in pieces the pillars and cut down the asherim and filled their places with the bones of men\\xa0 moreover the altar that was at bethel and the high place which jeroboam the son of nebat who made israel to sin had made even that altar and the high place he broke down and he burned the high place and stamped it small to powder and burned the asherah\\xa0 and as josiah turned himself he spied th',\n",
       "  'e sepulchres that were there in the mount and he sent and took the bones out of the sepulchres and burned them upon the altar and defiled it according to the word of the lord which the man of god proclaimed who proclaimed these things\\xa0 then he said what monument is that which i see and the men of the city told him it is the sepulchre of the man of god who came from judah and proclaimed these things that thou hast done against the altar of bethel\\xa0 and he said let him be let no man move his bones so they let his bones alone with the bones of the prophet that came out of samaria\\xa0 and all the houses also of the high places that were in the cities of samaria which the kings of israel had made to provoke  josiah took away and did to them according to all the acts that he had done in bethel\\xa0 and he slew all the priests of the high places that were there upon the altars and burned mens bones upon them and he returned to jerusalem\\xa0 and the king commanded all the people saying keep the passover unto the lord your god as it is written in this book of the covenant\\xa0 for there was not kept such a passover from the days of the judges that judged israel nor in all the days of the kings of israel nor of the kings of judah\\xa0 but in the eighteenth year of king josiah was this passover kept to the lord in jerusalem\\xa0 moreover them that divined by a ghost or a familiar spirit and the teraphim and the idols and all the detestable things that were spied in the land of judah and in jerusalem did josiah put away that he might confirm the words of the law which were written in the book that hilkiah the priest found in the house of the lord\\xa0 and like unto him was there no king before him that turned to the lord with all his heart and with all his soul and with all his might according to all the law of moses neither after him arose there any like him\\xa0 notwithstanding the lord turned not from the fierceness of his great wrath wherewith his anger was kindled against judah because of all the provocations wherewith manasseh had provoked him\\xa0 and the lord said i will remove judah also out of my sight as i have removed israel and i will cast off this city which i have chosen even jerusalem and the house of which i said my name shall be there\\xa0 now the rest of the acts of josiah and all that he did are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah\\xa0 in his days pharaohnecoh king of egypt went up against the king of assyria to the river euphrates and king josiah went against him and he slew him at megiddo when he had seen him\\xa0 and his servants carried him in a chariot dead from megiddo and brought him to jerusalem and buried him in his own sepulchre and the people of the land took jehoahaz the son of josiah and anointed him and made him king in his fathers stead \\xa0 jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign and he reigned three months in jerusalem and his mothers name was hamutal the daughter of jeremiah of libnah\\xa0 and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord according to all that his fathers had done\\xa0 and pharaohnecoh put him in bands at riblah in the land of hamath that he might not reign in jerusalem and put the land to a fine of a hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold\\xa0 and pharaohnecoh made eliakim the son of josiah king in the room of josiah his father and changed his name to jehoiakim but he took jehoahaz away and he came to egypt and died there\\xa0 and jehoiakim gave the silver and the gold to pharaoh but he taxed the land to give the money according to the commandment of pharaoh he exacted the silver and the gold of the people of the land of every one according to his taxation to give it unto pharaohnecoh s\\xa0 jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign and he reigned eleven years in jerusalem and his mothers name was zebudah the daughter of pedaiah of rumah\\xa0 and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord according to all that his fathers had done\\xa0 in his days nebuchadnezzar king of babylon came up and jehoiakim became his servant three years then he turned and rebelled against him\\xa0 and the lord sent against him bands of the chaldeans and bands of the arameans and bands of the moabites and bands of the children of ammon and sent them against judah to destroy it according to the word of the lord which he spoke by the hand of his servants the prophets\\xa0 surely at the commandment of the lord came this upon judah to remove them out of his sight for the sins of manasseh according to all that he did\\xa0 and also for the innocent blood that he shed for he filled jerusalem with innocent blood and the lord would not pardon\\xa0 now the rest of the acts of jehoiakim and all that he did are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah\\xa0 so jehoiakim slept with his fathers and jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead\\xa0 and the king of egypt came not again any more out of his land for the king of babylon had taken from the brook of egypt unto the river euphrates all that pertained to the king of egypt \\xa0 jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he began to reign and he reigned in jerusalem three months and his mothers name was nehushta the daughter of elnathan of jerusalem\\xa0 and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord according to all that his father had done\\xa0 at that time the servants of nebuchadnezzar king of babylon came up to jerusalem and the city was besieged\\xa0 and nebuchadnezzar king of babylon came unto the city while his servants were besieging it\\xa0 and jehoiachin the king of judah went out to the king of babylon he and his mother and his servants and his princes and his officers and the king of babylon took him in the eighth year of his reign\\xa0 and he carried out thence all the treasures of the house of the lord and the treasures of the kings house and cut in pieces all the vessels of gold which solomon king of israel had made in the temple of the lord as the lord had said\\xa0 and he carried away all jerusalem and all the princes and all the mighty men of valour even ten thousand captives and all the craftsmen and the smiths none remained save the poorest sort of the people of the land\\xa0 and he carried away jehoiachin to babylon and the kings mother and the kings wives and his officers and the chief men of the land carried he into captivity from jerusalem to babylon\\xa0 and all the men of might even seven thousand and the craftsmen and the smiths a thousand all of them strong and apt for war even them the king of babylon brought captive to babylon\\xa0 and the king of babylon made mattaniah his fathers brother king in his stead and changed his name to zedekiah \\xa0 zedekiah was twenty and one years old when he began to reign and he reigned eleven years in jerusalem and his mothers name was hamutal the daughter of jeremiah of libnah\\xa0 and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord according to all that jehoiakim had done\\xa0 for through the anger of the lord did it come to pass in jerusalem and judah until he had cast them out from his presence and zedekiah rebelled against the king of babylon s\\xa0 and it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign in the tenth month in the tenth day of the month that nebuchadnezzar king of babylon came he and all his army against jerusalem and encamped against it and they built forts against it round about\\xa0 so the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king zedekiah\\xa0 on the ninth day of the  month the famine was sore in the city so that there was no bread for the people of the land\\xa0 then a breach was made in the city and all the men of war  by night by the way of the gate between the two walls which was by the kings gardennow the chaldeans were against the city round aboutand the king went by the way of the arabah\\xa0 but the army of the chaldeans pursued after the king and overtook him in the plains of jericho and all his army was scattered from him\\xa0 then they took the king and carried him up unto the king of babylon to riblah and they gave judgment upon him\\xa0 and they slew the sons of zedekiah before his eyes and put out the eyes of zedekiah and bound him in fetters and carried him to babylon s\\xa0 now in the fifth month on the seventh day of the month which was the nineteenth year of king nebuchadnezzar king of babylon came nebuzaradan the captain of the guard a servant of the king of babylon unto jerusalem\\xa0 and he burnt the house of the lord and the kings house and all the houses of jerusalem even every great mans house burnt he with fire\\xa0 and all the army of the chaldeans that were with the captain of the guard broke down the walls of jerusalem round about\\xa0 and the residue of the people that were left in the city and those that fell away that fell to the king of babylon and the residue of the multitude did nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carry away captive\\xa0 but the captain of the guard left of the poorest of the land to be vinedressers and husbandmen\\xa0 and the pillars of brass that were in the house of the lord and the bases and the brazen sea that were in the house of the lord did the chaldeans break in pieces and carried the brass of them to babylon\\xa0 and the pots and the shovels and the snuffers and the pans and all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered took they away\\xa0 and the firepans and the basins that which was of gold in gold and that which was of silver in silver the captain of the guard took away\\xa0 the two pillars the one sea and the bases which solomon had made for the house of the lord the brass of all these vessels was without weight\\xa0 the height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits and a capital of brass was upon it and the height of the capital was three cubits with network and pomegranates upon the capital round about all of brass and like unto these had the second pillar with network\\xa0 and the captain of the guard took seraiah the chief priest and zephaniah the second priest and the three keepers of the door\\xa0 and out of the city he took an officer that was set over the men of war and five men of them that saw the kings face who were found in the city and the scribe of the captain of the host who mustered the people of the land and threescore men of the people of the land that were found in the city\\xa0 and nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them and brought them to the king of babylon to riblah\\xa0 and the king of babylon smote them and put them to death at riblah in the land of hamath so judah was carried away captive out of his land\\xa0 and as for the people that were left in the land of judah whom nebuchadnezzar king of babylon had left even over them he made gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan governor\\xa0 now when all the captains of the forces they and their men heard that the king of babylon had made gedaliah governor they came to gedaliah to mizpah even ishmael the son of nethaniah and johanan the son of kareah and seraiah the son of tanhumeth the netophathite and jaazaniah the son of the maacathite they and their men\\xa0 and gedaliah swore to them and to their men and said unto them fear not because of the servants of the chaldeans dwell in the land and serve the king of babylon and it shall be well with you \\xa0 but it came to pass in the seventh month that ishmael the son of nethaniah the son of elishama of the seed royal came and ten men with him and smote gedaliah that he died and the jews and the chaldeans that were with him at mizpah\\xa0 and all the people both small and great and the captains of the forces arose and came to egypt for they were afraid of the chaldeans s\\xa0 and it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of jehoiachin king of judah in the twelfth month on the seven and twentieth day of the month that evilmerodach king of babylon in the year that he began to reign did lift up the head of jehoiachin king of judah out of prison\\xa0 and he spoke kindly to him and set his throne above the throne of the kings that were with him in babylon\\xa0 and he changed his prison garments and did eat bread before him continually all the days of his life\\xa0 and for his allowance there was a continual allowance given him of the king every day a portion all the days '],\n",

walk in his paths for out of zion shall go forth the law and the word of the lord from jerusalem and he shall judge between the nations and shall decide for many peoples and they shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruninghooks nation shall not lift up sword against nation neither shall they learn war any more  o house of jacob come ye and let us walk in the light of the lord for thou hast forsaken thy people the house of jacob for they are replenished from the east and with soothsayers like the philistines and they please themselves in the brood of aliens their

wellbeloved a song of my beloved touching his vineyard my wellbeloved had a vineyard in a very fruitful hill and he digged it and cleared it of stones and planted it with the choicest vine and built a tower in the midst of it and also hewed out a vat therein and he looked that it should bring forth grapes and it brought forth wild grapes and now o inhabitants of jerusalem and men of judah judge i pray you betwixt me and my vineyard what could have been done more to my vineyard that i have not done in it wherefore when i looked that it should bring forth grapes brought it forth wild grapes and now come i will tell you what i will do to my vineyard i will take away the hedge thereof and it shall be eaten up i will break down the fence thereof and it shall be trodden down and i will lay it waste it shall not be pruned nor hoed but there shall come up briers and thorns i will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it for the vineyard of the lord of hosts is the house of israel and the men of judah the plant of his delight and he looked for justice but behold violence for righteousness but behold a cry  woe unto them that join house to house that lay field to field till there be no room and ye be made to dwell alone in the midst of the land in mine ears said the lord of hosts of a truth many houses shall be desolate even great and fair without inhabitant for ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath and the seed of a homer shall yield an ephah s woe unto them that rise up early in the morning that they may follow strong drink that tarry late into the night till wine inflame them and the harp and the psaltery the tabret and the pipe and wine are in their feasts but they regard not the work of the lord neither have they considered the operation of his hands therefore my people are gone into captivity for want of knowledge and their honourable men are famished and their multitude are parched with thirst therefore the netherworld hath enlarged her desire and opened her mouth without measure and down goeth their glory and their tumult and their uproar and he that rejoiceth among them and man is bowed down and man is humbled and the eyes of the lofty are humbled but the lord of hosts is exalted through justice and god the holy one is sanctified through righteousness then shall the lambs feed as in their pasture and the waste places of the fat ones shall wanderers eat s woe unto them that draw iniquity with cords of vanity and sin as it were with a cart rope that say let him make speed let him hasten his work that we may see it and let the counsel of the holy one of israel draw nigh and come that we may know it  woe unto them that call evil good and good evil that change darkness into light and light into darkness that change bitter into sweet and sweet into bitter s woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes and prudent in their own sight s woe unto them that are mighty to drink wine and men of strength to mingle strong drink that justify the wicked for a reward and take away the righteousness of the righteous from him  therefore as the tongue of fire devoureth the stubble and as the chaff is consumed in the flame so their root shall be as rottenness and their blossom shall go up as dust because they have rejected the law of the lord of hosts and contemned the word of the holy one of israel therefore is the anger of the lord kindled against his people and he hath stretched forth his hand against them and hath smitten them and the hills did tremble and their carcasses were as refuse in the midst of the streets for all this his anger is not turned away but his hand is stretched out still and he will lift up an ensign to the nations from far and will hiss unto them from the end of the earth and behold they shall come with speed swiftly none shall be weary nor stumble among them none shall slumber nor sleep neither shall the girdle of their loins be loosed nor the latchet of their shoes be broken whose arrows are sharp and all their bows bent their horses hoofs shall be counted like flint and their wheels like a whirlwind their roaring shall be like a lion they shall roar like young lions yea they shall roar

darkness and distress and the light is darkened in the skies thereof  in the year that king uzziah died i saw the lord sitting upon a throne high and lifted up and his train filled the temple above him stood the seraphim each one had six wings with twain he covered his face and with twain he covered his feet and with twain he did fly and one called unto another and said holy holy holy is the lord of hosts the whole earth is full of his glory and the posts of the door were moved at the voice of them that called and the house was filled with smoke then said i woe is me for i am undone because i am a man of unclean lips and i dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips for mine eyes have seen the king the lord of hosts then flew unto me one of the seraphim with a glowing stone in his hand which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar and he touched my mouth with it and said lo this hath touched thy lips and thine iniquity is taken away and thy sin expiated and i heard the voice of the lord saying whom shall i send and who will go for us then i said here am i send me and he said go and tell this people hear ye indeed but understand not and see ye indeed but perceive not make the heart of this people fat and make their ears heavy and shut their eyes lest they seeing with their eyes and hearing with their ears and understanding with their heart return and be healed then said i lord how long and he answered until cities be waste without inhabitant and houses without man and the land become utterly waste and the lord have removed men far away and the forsaken places be many in the midst of the land and if there be yet a tenth in it it shall again be eaten up as a terebinth and as an oak whose stock remaineth when they cast their leaves so the holy seed shall be the stock thereof  and it came to pass in the days of ahaz the son of jotham the son of uzziah king of judah that rezin the king of aram and pekah the son of remaliah king of israel went up to jerusalem to war against it but could not prevail against it and it was told the house of david saying aram is confederate with ephraim and his heart was moved and the heart of his people as the trees of the forest are moved with the wind s then said the lord unto isaiah go forth now to meet ahaz thou and shearjashub thy son at the end of the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fullers field and say unto him keep calm and be quiet fear not neither let thy heart be faint because of these two tails of smoking firebrands for the fierce anger of rezin and aram and of the son of remaliah because aram hath counselled evil against thee ephraim also and the son of remaliah saying let us go up against judah and vex it and let us make a breach therein for us and set up a king in the midst of it even the son of tabeel  thus saith the lord god it shall not stand neither shall it come to pass for the head of aram is damascus and the head of damascus is rezin and within threescore and five years shall ephraim be broken that it be not a people and the head of ephraim is samaria and the head of samaria is remaliahs son if ye will not have faith surely ye shall not be established  and the lord spoke again unto ahaz saying ask thee a sign of the lord thy god ask it either in the depth or in the height above but ahaz said i will not ask neither will i try the lord

sackcloth on their housetops and in their broad places every one howleth weeping profusely and heshbon crieth out and elealeh their voice is heard even unto jahaz therefore the armed men of moab cry aloud his soul is faint within him my heart crieth out for moab her fugitives reach unto zoar a heifer of three years old for by the ascent of luhith with weeping they go up for in the way of horonaim

hosts with thunder and with earthquake and great noise with whirlwind and tempest and the flame of a devouring fire and the multitude of all the nations that war against ariel even all that war against her and the bulwarks about her and they that distress her shall be as a dream a vision of the night and it shall be as when a hungry man dreameth and behold he eateth but he awaketh and his soul is empty or as when a thirsty man dreameth and behold he drinketh but he awaketh and behold he is faint and his soul hath appetiteso shall the multitude of all the nations be that fight against mount zion  stupefy yourselves and be stupid blind yourselves and be blind ye that are drunken but not with wine that stagger but not with strong drink for the lord hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep and hath closed your eyes the prophets and your heads the seers hath he covered and the vision of all this is become unto you as the words of a writing that is sealed which men deliver to one that is learned saying read this i pray thee and he saith i cannot for it is sealed and the writing is delivered to him that is not learned saying read this i pray thee and he saith i am not learned s and the lord said forasmuch as this people draw near and with their mouth and with their lips do honour me but have removed their heart far from me and their fear of me is a commandment of men learned by rote therefore behold i will again do a marvellous work among this people even a marvellous work and a wonder and the wisdom of their wise men shall perish and the prudence of their prudent men shall be hid s woe unto them that seek deep to hide their counsel from the lord and their works are in the dark and they say who seeth us and who knoweth us o your perversity shall the potter be esteemed as clay that the thing made should say of him that made it he made me not or the thing framed say of him that framed it he hath no understanding is it not yet a very little while and lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field and the fruitful field shall be esteemed as a forest and in that day shall the deaf hear the words of a book and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity and out of darkness the humble also shall increase their joy in the lord and the neediest among men shall exult in the holy one of israel for the terrible one is brought to nought and the scorner ceaseth and all they that watch for iniquity are cut off that make a man an offender by words and lay a snare for him that reproveth in the gate and turn aside the just with a thing of nought  therefore thus saith the lord who redeemed abraham concerning the house of jacob jacob shall not now be ashamed neither shall his face now wax pale when he seeth his children the work of my hands in the midst of him that they sanctify my name yea they shall sanctify the holy one of jacob and shall stand in awe of the god of israel they also that err in spirit shall come to understanding and they that murmur shall learn instruction s woe to the rebellious children saith the lord that take counsel but not of me and that form projects but not of my spirit that they may add sin to sin that walk to go down into egypt and have not asked at my mouth to take refuge in the stronghold of pharaoh and to take shelter in the shadow of egypt therefore shall the stronghold of pharaoh turn to your shame and the shelter in the shadow of egypt to your confusion for his princes are at zoan and his ambassadors are come to hanes they shall all be ashamed of a people that cannot profit them that are not a help nor profit but a shame and also a reproach s the burden of the beasts of the south through the land of trouble and anguish from whence come the lioness and the lion the viper and flying serpent they carry their riches upon the shoulders of young asses and their treasures upon the humps of camels to a people that shall not profit them for egypt helpeth in vain and to no purpose therefore have i called her arrogancy that sitteth still now go write it before them on a tablet and inscribe it in a book that it may be for the time to come for ever and ever for it is a rebellious people lying children children that refuse to hear the teaching of the lord that say to the seers see not and to the prophets prophesy not unto us right things speak unto us smooth things prophesy delusions get you out of the way turn aside out of the path cause the holy one of israel to cease from before us s wherefore thus saith the holy one of israel because ye despise this word and trust in oppression and perverseness and stay thereon therefore this iniquity shall be to you as a breach ready to fall swelling out in a high wall whose breaking cometh suddenly at an instant and he shall break it as a potters vessel is broken breaking it in pieces without sparing so that there shall not be found among the pieces thereof a sherd to take fire from the hearth or to take water out of the cistern s for thus said the lord god the holy one of israel in sitting still and rest shall ye be saved in quietness and in confidence shall be your strength and ye would not but ye said no for we will flee upon horses therefore shall ye flee and we will ride upon the swift therefore shall they that pursue you be swift one thousand shall flee at the rebuke of one at the rebuke of five shall ye flee till ye be left as a beacon upon the top of a mountain and as an ensign on a hill and therefore will the lord wait that he may be gracious unto you and therefore will he be exalted that he may have compassion upon you for the lord is a god of justice happy are all they that wait for him  for o people that dwellest in zion at jerusalem thou shalt weep no more he will surely be gracious unto thee at the voice of thy cry when he shall hear he will answer thee and though the lord give you sparing bread and scant water yet shall not thy teacher hide himself any more but thine eyes shall see thy teacher and thine ears shall hear a word behind thee saying this is the way walk ye in it when ye turn to the right hand and when ye turn to the left and ye shall defile thy graven images overlaid with silver and thy molten images covered with gold thou shalt put them far away as one unclean thou shalt say unto it get thee hence and he will give the rain for thy seed wherewith thou sowest the ground and bread of the increase of the ground and it shall be fat and plenteous in that day shall thy cattle feed in large pastures the oxen likewise and the young asses that till the ground shall eat savoury

when the towers fall moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold as the light of the seven days in the day that the lord bindeth up the bruise of his people and healeth the stroke of their wound  behold the name of the lord cometh from far with his anger burning and in thick uplifting of smoke his lips are full of indignation and his tongue is as a devouring fire and his breath is as an overflowing stream that divideth even unto the neck to sift the nations with the sieve of destruction and a bridle that causeth to err shall be in the jaws of the peoples ye shall have a song as in the night when a feast is hallowed and gladness of heart as when one goeth with the pipe to come into the mountain of the lord to the rock of israel and the lord will cause his glorious voice to be heard and will show the lighting down of his arm with furious anger and the flame of a devouring fire with a bursting of clouds and a storm of rain and hailstones for through the voice of the lord shall asshur be dismayed the rod with which he smote and in every place where the appointed staff shall pass which the lord shall lay upon him it shall be with tabrets and harps and in battles of wielding will he fight with them for a hearth is ordered of old yea for the king it is prepared deep and large the pile thereof is fire and much wood the breath of the lord like a stream of brimstone doth kindle it  woe to them that go down to egypt for help and rely on horses and trust in chariots because they are many and in horsemen because they are exceeding mighty but they look not unto the holy one of israel neither seek the lord yet he also is wise and bringeth evil and doth not call back his words but will arise against the house of the evildoers and against the help of them that work iniquity now the egyptians are men and not god and their horses flesh and not spirit so when the lord shall stretch out his hand both he that helpeth shall stumble and he that is helped shall fall and they all shall perish together s for thus saith the lord unto me like as the lion or the young lion growling over his prey though a multitude of shepherds be called forth against him w',\n",

flee away s now it came to pass in the fourteenth year of king hezekiah that sennacherib king of assyria came up against all the fortified cities of judah and took them and the king of assyria sent rabshakeh from lachish to jerusalem unto king hezekiah with a great army and he stood by the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fullers field then came forth unto him eliakim the son of hilkiah that was over the household and shebna the scribe and joah the son of asaph the recorder and rabshakeh said unto them say ye now to hezekiah thus saith the great king the king of assyria what confidence is this wherein thou trustest i said it is but vain words for counsel and strength are for the war now on whom dost thou trust that thou hast rebelled against me behold thou trustest upon the staff of this bruised reed even upon egypt whereon if a man lean it will go into his hand and pierce it so is pharaoh king of egypt to all that trust on him but if thou say unto me we trust in the lord our god is not that he whose high places and whose altars hezekiah hath taken away and hath said to judah and to jerusalem ye shall worship before this altar now therefore i pray thee make a wager with my master the king of assyria and i will give thee two thousand horses if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them how then canst thou turn away the face of one captain even of the least of my masters servants yet thou puttest thy trust on egypt for chariots and for horsemen and am i now come up without the lord against this land to destroy it the lord said unto me go up against this land and destroy it s then said eliakim and shebna and joah unto rabshakeh speak i pray thee unto thy servants in the aramean language for we understand it and speak not to us in the jews language in the ears of the people that are on the wall but rabshakeh said hath my master sent me to thy master and to thee to speak these words hath he not sent me to the men that sit upon the wall to eat their own dung and to drink their own water with you then rabshakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in the jews language and said hear ye the words of the great king the king of assyria thus saith the king let not hezekiah beguile you for he will not be able to deliver you neither let hezekiah make you trust in the lord saying the lord will surely deliver us this city shall not be given into the hand of the king of assyria hearken not to hezekiah p\\xa0for thus saith the king of assyria make your peace with me and come out to me and eat ye every one of his vine and every one of his figtree and drink ye every one the waters of his own cistern until i come and take you away to a land like your own land a land of corn and wine a land of bread and vineyards beware lest hezekiah persuade you saying the lord will deliver us hath any of the gods of the nations delivered his land out of the hand of the king of assyria where are the gods of hamath and arpad where are the gods of sepharvaim and have they delivered samaria out of my hand who are they among all the gods of these countries that have delivered their country out of my hand that the lord should deliver jerusalem out of my hand but they held their peace and answered him not a word for the kings commandment was saying answer him not then came eliakim the son of hilkiah that was over the household and shebna the scribe and joah the son of asaph the recorder to hezekiah with their clothes rent and told him the words of rabshakeh s and it came to pass when king hezekiah heard it that he rent his clothes and covered himself with sackcloth and went into the house of the lord and he sent eliakim who was over the household and shebna the scribe and the elders of the priests covered with sackcloth unto isaiah the prophet the son of amoz and they said unto him thus saith hezekiah this day is a day of trouble and of rebuke and of contumely for the children are come to the birth and there is not strength to bring forth it may be the lord thy god will hear the words of rabshakeh whom the king of assyria his master hath sent to taunt the living god and will rebuke the words which the lord thy god hath heard wherefore make prayer for the remnant that is left so the servants of king hezekiah came to isaiah and isaiah said unto them thus shall ye say to your master thus saith the lord be not afraid of the words that thou hast heard wherewith the servants of the king of assyria have blasphemed me behold i will put a spirit in him and he shall hear a rumour and shall return unto his own land and i will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land so rabshakeh returned and found the king of assyria warring against libnah for he had heard that he was departed from lachish and he heard say concerning tirhakah king of ethiopia he is come out to fight against thee and when he heard it he sent messengers to hezekiah saying thus shall ye speak to hezekiah king of judah saying let not thy god in whom thou trustest beguile thee saying jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of assyria behold thou hast heard what the kings of assyria have done to all lands by destroying them utterly and shalt thou be delivered have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed gozan and haran and rezeph and the children of eden that were in telassar where is the king of hamath and the king of arpad and the king of the city of sepharvaim of hena and ivvah and hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers and read it and hezekiah went up unto the house of the lord and spread it before the lord s and hezekiah prayed unto the lord saying o lord of hosts the god of israel that sittest upon the cherubim thou art the god even thou alone of all the kingdoms of the earth thou hast made heaven and earth incline thine ear o lord and hear open thine eyes o lord and see and hear all the words of sennacherib who hath sent to taunt the living god of a truth lord the kings of assyria have laid waste all the countries and their land and have cast their gods into the fire for they were no gods but the work of mens hands wood and stone therefore they have destroyed them now therefore o lord our god save us from his hand that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the lord even thou only then isaiah the son of amoz sent unto hezekiah saying thus saith the lord the god of israel whereas thou hast prayed to me against sennacherib king of assyria this is the word which the lord hath spoken concerning him the virgin daughter of zion hath despised thee and laughed thee to scorn the daughter of jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee whom hast thou taunted and blasphemed and against whom hast thou exalted thy voice yea thou hast lifted up thine eyes on high even against the holy one of israel by thy servants hast thou taunted the lord and hast said with the multitude of my chariots am i come up to the height of the mountains to the innermost parts of lebanon and i have cut down the tall cedars thereof and the choice cypresstrees thereof and i have entered into his farthest height the forest of his fruitful field i have digged and drunk water and with the sole of my feet have i dried up all the rivers of egypt hast thou not heard long ago i made it in ancient times i fashioned it now have i brought it to pass yea it is done that fortified cities should be laid waste into ruinous heaps therefore their inhabitants were of small power they were dismayed and confounded they were as the grass of the field and as the green herb as the grass on the housetops and as a field of corn before it is grown up but i know thy sitting down and thy going out and thy coming in and thy raging against me because of thy raging against me and for that thine uproar is come up into mine ears therefore will i put my hook in thy nose and my bridle in thy lips and i will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest and this shall be the sign unto thee ye shall eat this year that which groweth of itself and in the second year that which springeth of the same and in the third year sow ye and reap and plant vineyards and eat the fruit thereof and the remnant that is escaped of the house of judah shall again take root downward and bear fruit upward for out of jerusalem shall go forth a remnant and out of mount zion they that shall escape the zeal of the lord of hosts ',\n",
       "  'shall perform this s therefore thus saith the lord concerning the king of assyria he shall not come unto this city nor shoot an arrow there neither shall he come before it with shield nor cast a mound against it by the way that he came by the same shall he return and he shall not come unto this city saith the lord for i will defend this city to save it for mine own sake and for my servant davids sake s and the angel of the lord went forth and smote in the camp of the assyrians a hundred and fourscore and five thousand and when men arose early in the morning behold they were all dead corpses so sennacherib king of assyria departed and went and returned and dwelt at nineveh and it came to pass as he was worshipping in the house of nisroch his god that adrammelech and sarezer his sons smote him with the sword and they escaped into the land of ararat and esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead s in those days was hezekiah sick unto death and isaiah the prophet the son of amoz came to him and said unto him thus saith the lord set thy house in order for thou shalt die and not live then hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed unto the lord and said remember now o lord i beseech thee how i have walked before thee in truth and with a whole heart and have done that which is good in thy sight and hezekiah wept sore s then came the word of the lord to isaiah saying go and say to hezekiah thus saith the lord the god of david thy father i have heard thy prayer i have seen thy tears behold i will add unto thy days fifteen years and i will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of assyria and i will defend this city and this shall be the sign unto thee from the lord that the lord will do this thing that he hath spoken behold i will cause the shadow of the dial which is gone down on the sundial of ahaz to return backward ten degrees so the sun returned ten degrees by which degrees it was gone down s the writing of hezekiah king of judah when he had been sick and was recovered of his sickness i said in the noontide of my days i shall go even to the gates of the netherworld i am deprived of the residue of my years i said i shall not see the lord even the lord in the land of the living i shall behold man no more with the inhabitants of the world my habitation is plucked up and carried away from me as a shepherds tent i have rolled up like a weaver my life he will cut me off from the thrum from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me the more i make myself like unto a lion until morning the more it breaketh all my bones from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me like a swallow or a crane so do i chatter i do moan as a dove mine eyes fail with looking upward o lord i am oppressed be thou my surety what shall i say he hath both spoken unto me and himself hath done it i shall go softly all my years for the bitterness of my soul o lord by these things men live and altogether therein is the life of my spirit wherefore recover thou me and make me to live behold for my peace i had great bitterness but thou hast in love to my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption for thou hast cast all my sins behind thy back for the netherworld cannot praise thee death cannot celebrate thee they that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth the living the living he shall praise thee as i do this day the father to the children shall make known thy truth the lord is ready to save me therefore we will sing songs to the stringed instruments all the days of our life in the house of the lord and isaiah said let them take a cake of figs and lay it for a plaster upon the boil and he shall recover and hezekiah said what is the sign that i shall go up to the house of the lord s at that time merodachbaladan the son of baladan king of babylon sent a letter and a present to hezekiah for he heard that he had been sick and was recovered and hezekiah was glad of them and showed them his treasurehouse the silver and the gold and the spices and the precious oil and all the house of his armour and all that was found in his treasures there was nothing in his house nor in all his dominion that hezekiah showed them not s then came isaiah the prophet unto king hezekiah and said unto him what said these men and from whence came they unto thee and hezekiah said they are come from a far country unto me even from babylon then said he what have they seen in thy house and hezekiah answered all that is in my house have they seen there is nothing among my treasures that i have not shown them then said isaiah to hezekiah hear the word of the lord of hosts behold the days come that all that is in thy house and that which thy fathers have laid up in store until this day shall be carried to babylon nothing shall be left saith the lord and of thy sons that shall issue from thee whom thou shalt beget shall they take away and they shall be officers in the palace of the king of babylon then said hezekiah unto isaiah good is the word of the lord which thou hast spoken he said moreover if but there shall be peace and truth in my days  comfort ye comfort ye my people saith your god bid jerusalem take heart and proclaim unto her that her time of service is accomplished that her guilt is paid off that she hath received of the lords hand double for all her sins s hark one calleth clear ye in the wilderness the way of the lord make plain in the desert a highway for our god every valley shall be lifted up and every mountain and hill shall be made low and the rugged shall be made level and the rough places a plain and the glory of the lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together for the mouth of the lord hath spoken it  hark one saith proclaim and he saith what shall i proclaim all flesh is grass and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field the grass withereth the flower fadeth because the breath of the lord bloweth upon itsurely the people is grass the grass withereth the flower fadeth but the word of our god shall stand for ever s o thou that tellest good tidings to zion get thee up into the high mountain o thou that tellest good tidings to jerusalem lift up thy voice with strength lift it up be not afraid say unto the cities of judah behold your god behold the lord god will come as a mighty one and his arm will rule for him behold his reward is with him and his recompense before him even as a shepherd that feedeth his flock that gathereth the lambs in his arm and carrieth them in his bosom and gently leadeth those that give suck s who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand and meted out heaven with the span and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure and weighed the mountains in scales and the hills in a balance who hath meted out the spirit of the lord or who was his counsellor that he might instruct him with whom took he counsel and who instructed him and taught him in the path of right and taught him knowledge and made him to know the way of discernment behold the nations are as a drop of a bucket and are counted as the small dust of the balance behold the isles are as a mote in weight and lebanon is not sufficient fuel nor the beasts thereof sufficient for burntofferings  all the nations are as nothing before him they are accounted by him as things of nought and vanity to whom then will ye liken god or what likeness will ye compare unto him the image perchance which the craftsman hath melted and the goldsmith spread over with gold the silversmith casting silver chains a holmoak is set apart he chooseth a tree that will not rot he seeketh unto him a cunning craftsman to set up an image that shall not be moved s know ye not hear ye not hath it not been told you from the beginning have ye not understood the foundations of the earth it is he that sitteth above the circle of the earth and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers that stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in that bringeth princes to nothing he maketh the judges of the earth as a thing of nought scarce are they planted scarce are they sown scarce hath

with his generation who did reason for he was cut off out of the land of the living for the transgression of my people to whom the stroke was due and they made his grave with the wicked and with the rich his tomb although he had done no violence neither was any deceit in his mouth yet it pleased the lord to crush him by disease to see if his soul would offer itself in restitution that he might see his seed prolong his days and that the purpose of the lord might prosper by his hand of the travail of his soul he shall see to the full even my servant who by his knowledge did justify the

like the whirlwind to render his anger with fury and his rebuke with flames of fire for by fire will the lord contend and by his sword with all flesh and the slain of the lord shall be many they that sanctify themselves and purify themselves to go unto the gardens behind one in the midst eating swines flesh and the detestable thing and the mouse shall be consumed together saith the lord for i  their works and their thoughts  cometh that i will gather all nations and tongues and they shall come and shall see my glory and i will work a sign among them and i will send such as escape of them unto the nations to tarshish pul and lud that draw the bow to tubal and javan to the isles afar off that have not heard my fame neither have seen my glory and they shall declare my glory among the nations and they shall bring all your brethren out of all the nations for an offering unto the lord upon horses and in chariots and in litters and upon mules and upon swift beasts to my holy mountain jerusalem saith the lord as the children of israel bring their offering in a clean vessel into the house of the lord and of them also will i take for the priests and for the levites saith the lord for as the new heavens and the new earth which i will make shall remain before me saith the lord so shall your seed and your name remain and it shall come to pass that from one new moon to another and from one sabbath to another shall all flesh come to worship before me saith the lord and they shall go forth and look upon the carcasses of the men that have rebelled against me for their worm shall

       " ['\\xa0 now there was a certain man of ramathaimzophim of the hillcountry of ephraim and his name was elkanah the son of jeroham the son of elihu the son of tohu the son of zuph an ephraimite\\xa0 and he had two wives the name of the one was hannah and the name of the other peninnah and peninnah had children but hannah had no children\\xa0 and this man went up out of his city from year to year to worship and to sacrifice unto the lord of hosts in shiloh and the two sons of eli hophni and phinehas were there priests unto the lord\\xa0 and it came to pass upon a day when elkanah sacrificed that he gave to peninnah his wife and to all her sons and her daughters portions\\xa0 but unto hannah he gave a double portion for he loved hannah but the lord had shut up her womb\\xa0 and her rival vexed her sore to make her fret because the lord had shut up her womb\\xa0 and as he did so year by year when she went up to the house of the lord so she vexed her therefore she wept and would not eat\\xa0 and elkanah her husband said unto her hannah why weepest thou and why eatest thou not and why is thy heart grieved am not i better to thee than ten sons\\xa0 so hannah rose up after they had eaten in shiloh and after they had drunknow eli the priest sat upon his seat by the doorpost of the temple of the lord\\xa0 and she was in bitterness of souland prayed unto the lord and wept sore\\xa0 and she vowed a vow and said o lord of hosts if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thy handmaid and remember me and not forget thy handmaid but wilt give unto thy handmaid a manchild then i will give him unto the lord all the days of his life and there shall no razor come upon his head\\xa0 and it came to pass as she prayed long before the lord that eli watched her mouth\\xa0 now hannah she spoke in her heart only her lips moved but her voice could not be heard therefore eli thought she had been drunken\\xa0 and eli said unto her how long wilt thou be drunken put away thy wine from thee\\xa0 and hannah answered and said no my lord i am a woman of a sorrowful spirit i have drunk neither wine nor strong drink but i poured out my soul before the lord\\xa0 count not thy handmaid for a wicked woman for out of the abundance of my complaint and my vexation have i spoken hitherto\\xa0 then eli answered and said go in peace and the god of israel grant thy petition that thou hast asked of him\\xa0 and she said let thy servant find favour in thy sight so the woman went her way and did eat and her countenance was no more sad\\xa0 and they rose up in the morning early and worshipped before the lord and returned and came to their house to ramah and elkanah knew hannah his wife and the lord remembered her\\xa0 and it came to pass when the time was come about that hannah conceived and bore a son and she called his name samuel because i have asked him of the lord\\xa0 and the man elkanah and all his house went up to offer unto the lord the yearly sacrifice and his vow\\xa0 but hannah went not up for she said unto her husband until the child be weaned when i will bring him that he may appear before the lord and there abide for ever\\xa0 and elkanah her husband said unto her do what seemeth thee good tarry until thou have weaned him only the lord establish his word so the woman tarried and gave her son suck until she weaned him\\xa0 and when she had weaned him she took him up with her with three bullocks and one ephah of meal and a bottle of wine and brought him unto the house of the lord in shiloh and the child was young\\xa0 and when the bullock was slain the child was brought to eli\\xa0 and she said oh my lord as thy soul liveth my lord i am the woman that stood by thee here praying unto the lord\\xa0 for this child i prayed and the lord hath granted me my petition which i asked of him\\xa0 therefore i also have lent him to the lord as long as he liveth he is lent to the lord and he worshipped the lord there s\\xa0 and hannah prayed and said my heart exulteth in the lord my horn is exalted in the lord my mouth is enlarged over mine enemies because i rejoice in thy salvation\\xa0 there is none holy as the lord for there is none beside thee neither is there any rock like our god\\xa0 multiply not exceeding proud talk let not arrogancy come out of your mouth for the lord is a god of knowledge and by him actions are weighed\\xa0 the bows of the mighty men are broken and they that stumbled are girded with strength\\xa0 they that were full have hired out themselves for bread and they that were hungry have ceased while the barren hath borne seven she that had many children hath languished\\xa0 the lord killeth and maketh alive he bringeth down to the grave and bringeth up\\xa0 the lord maketh poor and maketh rich he bringeth low he also lifteth up\\xa0 he raiseth up the poor out of the dust he lifteth up the needy from the dunghill to make them sit with princes and inherit the throne of glory for the pillars of the earth are the lords and he hath set the world upon them\\xa0 he will keep the feet of his holy ones but the wicked shall be put to silence in darkness for not by strength shall man prevail\\xa0 they that strive with the lord shall be broken to pieces against them will he thunder in heaven the lord will judge the ends of the earth and he will give strength unto his king and exalt the horn of his anointed \\xa0 and elkanah went to ramah to his house and the child did minister unto the lord before eli the priest\\xa0 now the sons of eli were base men they knew not the lord\\xa0 and the custom of the priests with the people was that when any man offered sacrifice the priests servant came while the flesh was in seething with a fleshhook of three teeth in his hand\\xa0 and he struck it into the pan or kettle or caldron or pot all that the fleshhook brought up the priest took therewith so they did unto all the israelites that came thither in shiloh\\xa0 yea before the fat was made to smoke the priests servant came and said to the man that sacrificed give flesh to roast for the priest for he will not have sodden flesh of thee but raw\\xa0 and if the man said unto him let the fat be made to smoke first of all and then take as much as thy soul desireth then he would say nay but thou shalt give it me now and if not i will take it by force\\xa0 and the sin of the young men was very great before the lord for the men dealt contemptuously with the offering of the lord\\xa0 but samuel ministered before the lord being a child girded with a linen ephod\\xa0 moreover his mother made him a little robe and brought it to him from year to year when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice\\xa0 and eli would bless elkanah and his wife and say the lord give thee seed of this woman for the loan which was lent to the lord and they would go unto their own home\\xa0 so the lord remembered hannah and she conceived and bore three sons and two daughters and the child samuel grew before the lord s\\xa0 now eli was very old and he heard all that his sons did unto all israel and how that they lay with the women that did service at the door of the tent of meeting\\xa0 and he said unto them why do ye such things for i hear evil reports concerning you from all this people\\xa0 nay my sons for it is no good report which i hear the lords people do spread abroad\\xa0 if one man sin against another god shall judge him but if a man sin against the lord who shall entreat for him but they hearkened not unto the voice of their father because the lord would slay them\\xa0 and the child samuel grew on and increased in favour both with the lord and also with men \\xa0 and there came a man of god unto eli and said unto him thus saith the lord did i reveal myself unto the house of thy father when they were in egypt in bondage to pharaohs house\\xa0 and did i choose him out of all the tribes of israel to be my priest to go up unto mine altar to burn incense to wear an ephod before me and did i give unto the house of thy father all the offerings of the children of israel made by fire\\xa0 wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at mine offering which i have commanded in my habitation and honourest thy sons above me to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of israel my people\\xa0 therefore the lord the god of israel saith i said indeed that thy house and the house of thy father should walk before me for ever but now the lord saith be it far from me for them that honour me i will honour and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed\\xa0 behold the days come that i will cut off thine arm and the arm of thy fathers house that there shall not be an old man in thy house\\xa0 and thou shalt behold a rival in my habitation in all the good which shall be done to israel and there shall not be an old man in thy house for ever\\xa0 yet will i not cut off every man of thine from mine altar to make thine eyes to fail and thy heart to languish and all the increase of thy house shall die young men\\xa0 and this shall be the sign unto thee that which shall come upon thy two sons on hophni and phinehas in one day they shall die both of them\\xa0 and i will raise me up a faithful priest that shall do according to that which is in my heart and in my mind and i will build him a sure house and he shall walk before mine anointed for ever\\xa0 and it shall come to pass that every one that is left in thy house shall come and bow down to him for a piece of silver and a loaf of bread and shall say put me i pray thee into one of the priests offices that i may eat a morsel of bread \\xa0 and the child samuel ministered unto the lord before eli and the word of the lord was precious in those days there was no frequent vision s\\xa0 and it came to pass at that time when eli was laid down in his placenow his eyes had begun to wax dim that he could not see\\xa0 and the lamp of god was not yet gone out and samuel was laid down to sleep in the temple of the lord where the ark of god was \\xa0 that the lord called samuel and he said here am i\\xa0 and he ran unto eli and said here am i for thou didst call me and he said i called not lie down again and he went and lay down s\\xa0 and the lord called yet again samuel and samuel arose and went to eli and said here am i for thou didst call me and he answered i called not my son lie down again\\xa0 now samuel did not yet know the lord neither was the word of the lord yet revealed unto him\\xa0 and the lord called samuel again the third time and he arose and went to eli and said here am i for thou didst call me and eli perceived that the lord was calling the child\\xa0 therefore eli said unto samuel go lie down and it shall be if thou be called that thou shalt say speak lord for thy servant heareth so samuel went and lay down in his place\\xa0 and the lord came and stood and called as at other times samuel samuel then samuel said speak for thy servant heareth \\xa0 and the lord said to samuel behold i will do a thing in israel at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle\\xa0 in that day i will perform against eli all that i have spoken concerning his house from the beginning even unto the end\\xa0 for i have told him that i will judge his house for ever for the iniquity in that he knew that his sons did bring a curse upon themselves and he rebuked them not\\xa0 and therefore i have sworn unto the house of eli that the iniquity of elis house shall not be expiated with sacrifice nor offering for ever\\xa0 and samuel lay until the morning and opened the doors of the house of the lord and samuel feared to tell eli the vision\\xa0 then eli called samuel and said samuel my son and he said here am i\\xa0 and he said what is the thing that he hath spoken unto thee i pray thee hide it not from me god do so to thee and more also if thou hide any thing from me of all the things t',\n",
       "  'hat he spoke unto thee\\xa0 and samuel told him all the words and hid nothing from him and he said it is the lord let him do what seemeth him good \\xa0 and samuel grew and the lord was with him and did let none of his words fall to the ground\\xa0 and all israel from dan even to beersheba knew that samuel was established to be a prophet of the lord s\\xa0 and the lord appeared again in shiloh for the lord revealed himself to samuel in shiloh by the word of the lord \\xa0 and the word of samuel came to all israel now israel went out against the philistines to battle and pitched beside ebenezer and the philistines pitched in aphek\\xa0 and the philistines put themselves in array against israel and when the battle was spread israel was smitten before the philistines and they slew of the army in the field about four thousand men\\xa0 and when the people were come into the camp the elders of israel said wherefore hath the lord smitten us today before the philistines let us fetch the ark of the covenant of the lord out of shiloh unto us that he may come among us and save us out of the hand of our enemies\\xa0 so the people sent to shiloh and they brought from thence the ark of the covenant of the lord of hosts who sitteth upon the cherubim and the two sons of eli hophni and phinehas were there with the ark of the covenant of god\\xa0 and when the ark of the covenant of the lord came into the camp all israel shouted with a great shout so that the earth rang\\xa0 and when the philistines heard the noise of the shout they said what meaneth the noise of this great shout in the camp of the hebrews and they knew that the ark of the lord was come into the camp\\xa0 and the philistines were afraid for they said god is come into the camp and they said woe unto us for there was not such a thing yesterday and the day before\\xa0 woe unto us who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty gods these are the gods that smote the egyptians with all manner of plagues and in the wilderness\\xa0 be strong and quit yourselves like men o ye philistines that ye be not servants unto the hebrews as they have been to you quit yourselves like men and fight\\xa0 and the philistines fought and israel was smitten and they fled every man to his tent and there was a very great slaughter for there fell of israel thirty thousand footmen\\xa0 and the ark of god was taken and the two sons of eli hophni and phinehas were slain\\xa0 and there ran a man of benjamin out of the army and came to shiloh the same day with his clothes rent and with earth upon his head\\xa0 and when he came lo eli sat upon his seat by the wayside watching for his heart trembled for the ark of god and when the man came into the city and told it all the city cried out\\xa0 and when eli heard the noise of the crying he said what meaneth the noise of this tumult and the man made haste and came and told eli\\xa0 now eli was ninety and eight years old and his eyes were set that he could not see\\xa0 and the man said unto eli i am he that came out of the army and i fled today out of the army and he said how went the matter my son\\xa0 and he that brought the tidings answered and said israel is fled before the philistines and there hath been also a great slaughter among the people and thy two sons also hophni and phinehas are dead and the ark of god is taken \\xa0 and it came to pass when he made mention of the ark of god that he fell from off his seat backward by the side of the gate and his neck broke and he died for he was an old man and heavy and he had judged israel forty years\\xa0 and his daughterinlaw phinehas wife was with child near to be delivered and when she heard the tidings that the ark of god was taken and that her fatherinlaw and her husband were dead she bowed herself and brought forth for her pains came suddenly upon her\\xa0 and about the time of her death the women that stood by her said unto her fear not for thou hast brought forth a son but she answered not neither did she regard it\\xa0 and she named the child ichabod saying the glory is departed from israel because the ark of god was taken and because of her fatherinlaw and her husband\\xa0 and she said the glory is departed from israel for the ark of god is taken \\xa0 now the philistines had taken the ark of god and they brought it from ebenezer unto ashdod\\xa0 and the philistines took the ark of god and brought it into the house of dagon and set it by dagon\\xa0 and when they of ashdod arose early on the morrow behold dagon was fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of the lord and they took dagon and set him in his place again\\xa0 and when they arose early on the morrow morning behold dagon was fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of the lord and the head of dagon and both the palms of his hands lay cut off upon the threshold only the trunk of dagon was left to him\\xa0 therefore neither the priests of dagon nor any that come into dagons house tread on the threshold of dagon in ashdod unto this day \\xa0 but the hand of the lord was heavy upon them of ashdod and he destroyed them and smote them with emerods even ashdod and the borders thereof\\xa0 and when the men of ashdod saw that it was so they said the ark of the god of israel shall not abide with us for his hand is sore upon us and upon dagon our god\\xa0 they sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the philistines unto them and said what shall we do with the ark of the god of israel and they answered let the ark of the god of israel be carried about unto gath and they carried the ark of the god of israel about thither s\\xa0 and it was so that after they had carried it about the hand of the lord was against the city with a very great discomfiture and he smote the men of the city both small and great and emerods broke out upon them\\xa0 so they sent the ark of god to ekron and it came to pass as the ark of god came to ekron that the ekronites cried out saying they have brought about the ark of the god of israel to us to slay us and our people\\xa0 they sent therefore and gathered together all the lords of the philistines and they said send away the ark of the god of israel and let it go back to its own place that it slay us not and our people for there was a deadly discomfiture throughout all the city the hand of god was very heavy there\\xa0 and the men that died not were smitten with the emerods and the cry of the city went up to heaven s\\xa0 and the ark of the lord was in the country of the philistines seven months\\xa0 and the philistines called for the priests and the diviners saying what shall we do with the ark of the lord declare unto us wherewith we shall send it to its place s\\xa0 and they said if ye send away the ark of the god of israel send it not empty but in any wise return him a guiltoffering then ye shall be healed and it shall be known to you why his hand is not removed from you\\xa0 then said they what shall be the guiltoffering which we shall return to him and they said five golden emerods and five golden mice according to the number of the lords of the philistines for one plague was on you all and on your lords\\xa0 wherefore ye shall make images of your emerods and images of your mice that mar the land and ye shall give glory unto the god of israel peradventure he will lighten his hand from off you and from off your gods and from off your land\\xa0 wherefore then do ye harden your hearts as the egyptians and pharaoh hardened their hearts when he had wrought among them did they not let the people go and they departed\\xa0 now therefore take and prepare you a new cart and two milch kine on which there hath come no yoke and tie the kine to the cart and bring their calves home from them\\xa0 and take the ark of the lord and lay it upon the cart and put the jewels of gold which ye return him for a guiltoffering in a coffer by the side thereof and send it away that it may go\\xa0 and see if it goeth up by the way of its own border to bethshemesh then he hath done us this great evil but if not then we shall know that it is not his hand that smote us it was a chance that happened to us\\xa0 and the men did so and took two milch kine and tied them to the cart and shut up their calves at home\\xa0 and they put the ark of the lord upon the cart and the coffer with the mice of gold and the images of their emerods\\xa0 and the kine took the straight way by the way to bethshemesh they went along the highway lowing as they went and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left and the lords of the philistines went after them unto the border of bethshemesh\\xa0 and they of bethshemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley and they lifted up their eyes and saw the ark and rejoiced to see it\\xa0 and the cart came into the field of joshua the bethshemite and stood there where there was a great stone and they cleaved the wood of the cart and offered up the kine for a burntoffering unto the lord s\\xa0 and the levites took down the ark of the lord and the coffer that was with it wherein the jewels of gold were and put them on the great stone and the men of bethshemesh offered burntofferings and sacrificed sacrifices the same day unto the lord\\xa0 and when the five lords of the philistines had seen it they returned to ekron the same day s\\xa0 and these are the golden emerods which the philistines returned for a guiltoffering unto the lord for ashdod one for gaza one for ashkelon one for gath one for ekron one\\xa0 and the golden mice according to the number of all the cities of the philistines belonging to the five lords both of fortified cities and of country villages even unto abel by the great stone whereon they set down the ark of the lord which stone remaineth unto this day in the field of joshua the bethshemite\\xa0 and he smote of the men of bethshemesh because they had gazed upon the ark of the lord even he smote of the people seventy men and fifty thousand men and the people mourned because the lord had smitten the people with a great slaughter\\xa0 and the men of bethshemesh said who is able to stand before the lord this holy god and to whom shall it go up from us\\xa0 and they sent messengers to the inhabitants of kiriathjearim saying the philistines have brought back the ark of the lord come ye down and fetch it up to you\\xa0 and the men of kiriathjearim came and fetched up the ark of the lord and brought it into the house of abinadab in the hill and sanctified eleazar his son to keep the ark of the lord \\xa0 and it came to pass from the day that the ark abode in kiriathjearim that the time was long for it was twenty years and all the house of israel yearned after the lord s\\xa0 and samuel spoke unto all the house of israel saying if ye do return unto the lord with all your heart then put away the foreign gods and the ashtaroth from among you and direct your hearts unto the lord and serve him only and he will deliver you out of the hand of the philistines\\xa0 then the children of israel did put away the baalim and the ashtaroth and served the lord only \\xa0 and samuel said gather all israel to mizpah and i will pray for you unto the lord\\xa0 and they gathered together to mizpah and drew water and poured it out before the lord and fasted on that day and said there we have sinned against the lord and samuel judged the children of israel in mizpah\\xa0 and when the philistines heard that the children of israel were gathered together to mizpah the lords of the philistines went up against israel and when the children of israel heard it they were afraid of the philistines\\xa0 and the children of israel said to samuel cease not to cry unto the lord our god for us that he save us out of the hand of the philistines\\xa0 and samuel took a sucking lamb and offered it for a wh',\n",
       "  'ole burntoffering unto the lord and samuel cried unto the lord for israel and the lord answered him\\xa0 and as samuel was offering up the burntoffering the philistines drew near to battle against israel but the lord thundered with a great thunder on that day upon the philistines and discomfited them and they were smitten down before israel\\xa0 and the men of israel went out of mizpah and pursued the philistines and smote them until they came under bethcar\\xa0 then samuel took a stone and set it between mizpah and shen and called the name of it ebenezer saying hitherto hath the lord helped us\\xa0 so the philistines were subdued and they came no more within the border of israel and the hand of the lord was against the philistines all the days of samuel\\xa0 and the cities which the philistines had taken from israel were restored to israel from ekron even unto gath and the border thereof did israel deliver out of the hand of the philistines and there was peace between israel and the amorites\\xa0 and samuel judged israel all the days of his life\\xa0 and he went from year to year in circuit to bethel and gilgal and mizpah and he judged israel in all those places\\xa0 and his return was to ramah for there was his house and there he judged israel and he built there an altar unto the lord \\xa0 and it came to pass when samuel was old that he made his sons judges over israel\\xa0 now the name of his firstborn was joel and the name of his second abijah they were judges in beersheba\\xa0 and his sons walked not in his ways but turned aside after lucre and took bribes and perverted justice \\xa0 then all the elders of israel gathered themselves together and came to samuel unto ramah\\xa0 and they said unto him behold thou art old and thy sons walk not in thy ways now make us a king to judge us like all the nations\\xa0 but the thing displeased samuel when they said give us a king to judge us and samuel prayed unto the lord \\xa0 and the lord said unto samuel hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee for they have not rejected thee but they have rejected me that i should not be king over them\\xa0 according to all the works which they have done since the day that i brought them up out of egypt even unto this day in that they have forsaken me and served other gods so do they also unto thee\\xa0 now therefore hearken unto their voice howbeit thou shalt earnestly forewarn them and shalt declare unto them the manner of the king that shall reign over them s\\xa0 and samuel told all the words of the lord unto the people that asked of him a king s\\xa0 and he said this will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you he will take your sons and appoint them unto him for his chariots and to be his horsemen and they shall run before his chariots\\xa0 and he will appoint them unto him for captains of thousands and captains of fifties and to plow his ground and to reap his harvest and to make his instruments of war and the instruments of his chariots\\xa0 and he will take your daughters to be perfumers and to be cooks and to be bakers\\xa0 and he will take your fields and your vineyards and your oliveyards even the best of them and give them to his servants\\xa0 and he will take the tenth of your seed and of your vineyards and give to his officers and to his servants\\xa0 and he will take your menservants and your maidservants and your goodliest young men and your asses and put them to his work\\xa0 he will take the tenth of your flocks and ye shall be his servants\\xa0 and ye shall cry out in that day because of your king whom ye shall have chosen you and the lord will not answer you in that day\\xa0 but the people refused to hearken unto the voice of samuel and they said nay but there shall be a king over us\\xa0 that we also may be like all the nations and that our king may judge us and go out before us and fight our battles\\xa0 and samuel heard all the words of the people and he spoke them in the ears of the lord \\xa0 and the lord said to samuel hearken unto their voice and make them a king and samuel said unto the men of israel go ye every man unto his city \\xa0 now there was a man of benjamin whose name was kish the son of abiel the son of zeror the son of becorath the son of aphiah the son of a benjamite a mighty man of valour\\xa0 and he had a son whose name was saul young and goodly and there was not among the children of israel a goodlier person than he from his shoulders and upward he was higher than any of the people\\xa0 now the asses of kish sauls father were lost and kish said to saul his son take now one of the servants with thee and arise go seek the asses\\xa0 and he passed through the hillcountry of ephraim and passed through the land of shalishah but they found them not then they passed through the land of shaalim and there they were not and he passed through the land of the benjamites but they found them not\\xa0 when they were come to the land of zuph saul said to his servant that was with him come and let us return lest my father leave caring for the asses and become anxious concerning us\\xa0 and he said unto him behold now there is in this city a man of god and he is a man that is held in honour all that he saith cometh surely to pass now let us go thither peradventure he can tell us concerning our journey whereon we go\\xa0 then said saul to his servant but behold if we go what shall we bring the man for the bread is spent in our vessels and there is not a present to bring to the man of god what have we\\xa0 and the servant answered saul again and said behold i have in my hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver that will i give to the man of god to tell us our way\\xa0 beforetime in israel when a man went to inquire of god thus he said come and let us go to the seer for he that is now called a prophet was beforetime called a seer\\xa0 then said saul to his servant well said come let us go so they went unto the city where the man of god was\\xa0 as they went up the ascent to the city they found young maidens going out to draw water and said unto them is the seer here\\xa0 and they answered them and said he is behold he is before thee make haste now for he is come today into the city for the people have a sacrifice today in the high place\\xa0 as soon as ye are come into the city ye shall straightway find him before he go up to the high place to eat for the people will not eat until he come because he doth bless the sacrifice and afterwards they eat that are bidden now therefore get you up for at this time ye shall find him\\xa0 and they went up to the city and as they came within the city behold samuel came out toward them to go up to the high place s\\xa0 now the lord had revealed unto samuel a day before saul came saying\\xa0 tomorrow about this time i will send thee a man out of the land of benjamin and thou shalt anoint him to be prince over my people israel and he shall save my people out of the hand of the philistines for i have looked upon my people because their cry is come unto me\\xa0 and when samuel saw saul the lord spoke unto him behold the man of whom i said unto thee this same shall have authority over my people\\xa0 then saul drew near to samuel in the gate and said tell me i pray thee where the seers house is\\xa0 and samuel answered saul and said i am the seer go up before me unto the high place for ye shall eat with me today and in the morning i will let thee go and will tell thee all that is in thy heart\\xa0 and as for thine asses that were lost three days ago set not thy mind on them for they are found and on whom is all the desire of israel is it not on thee and on all thy fathers house s\\xa0 and saul answered and said am not i a benjamite of the smallest of the tribes of israel and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of benjamin wherefore then speakest thou to me after this manner s\\xa0 and samuel took saul and his servant and brought them into the chamber and made them sit in the chiefest place among them that were bidden who were about thirty persons\\xa0 and samuel said unto the cook bring the portion which i gave thee of which i said unto thee set it by thee\\xa0 and the cook took up the thigh and that which was upon it and set it before saul and  said behold that which hath been reserved set it before thee and eat because unto the appointed time hath it been kept for thee for i said i have invited the people so saul did eat with samuel that day\\xa0 and when they were come down from the high place into the city he spoke with saul upon the housetop\\xa0 and they arose early and it came to pass about the break of day that samuel called to saul on the housetop saying up that i may send thee away and saul arose and they went out both of them he and samuel abroad\\xa0 as they were going down at the end of the city samuel said to saul bid the servant pass on before usand he passed onbut stand thou still at this time that i may cause thee to hear the word of god \\xa0 then samuel took the vial of oil and poured it upon his head and kissed him and said is it not that the lord hath anointed thee to be prince over his inheritance\\xa0 when thou art departed from me today then thou shalt find two men by the tomb of rachel in the border of benjamin at zelzah and they will say unto thee the asses which thou wentest to seek are found and lo thy father hath left off caring for the asses and is anxious concerning you saying what shall i do for my son\\xa0 then shalt thou go on forward from thence and thou shalt come to the terebinth of tabor and there shall meet thee there three men going up to god to bethel one carrying three kids and another carrying three loaves of bread and another carrying a bottle of wine\\xa0 and they will salute thee and give thee two cakes of bread which thou shalt receive of their hand\\xa0 after that thou shalt come to the hill of god where is the garrison of the philistines and it shall come to pass when thou art come thither to the city that thou shalt meet a band of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery and a timbrel and a pipe and a harp before them and they will be prophesying\\xa0 and the spirit of the lord will come mightily upon thee and thou shalt prophesy with them and shalt be turned into another man\\xa0 and let it be when these signs are come unto thee that thou do as thy hand shall find for god is with thee\\xa0 and thou shalt go down before me to gilgal and behold i will come down unto thee to offer burntofferings and to sacrifice sacrifices of peaceofferings seven days shalt thou tarry till i come unto thee and tell thee what thou shalt do\\xa0 and it was so that when he had turned his back to go from samuel god gave him another heart and all those signs came to pass that day s\\xa0 and when they came thither to the hill behold a band of prophets met him and the spirit of god came mightily upon him and he prophesied among them\\xa0 and it came to pass when all that knew him beforetime saw that behold he prophesied with the prophets s then the people said one to another what is this that is come unto the son of kish is saul also among the prophets\\xa0 and one of the same place answered and said and who is their father therefore it became a proverb is saul also among the prophets\\xa0 and when he had made an end of prophesying he came to the high place\\xa0 and sauls uncle said unto him and to his servant whither went ye and he said to seek the asses and when we saw that they were not found we came to samuel\\xa0 and sauls uncle said tell me i pray thee what samuel said unto you\\xa0 and saul said unto his uncle he told us plainly that the asses were found but concerning the matter of the kingdom whereof samuel spoke he told him not \\xa0 and samuel called the people together unto th',\n",
       "  'e lord to mizpah\\xa0 and he said unto the children of israel p\\xa0thus saith the lord the god of israel i brought up israel out of egypt and i delivered you out of the hand of the egyptians and out of the hand of all the kingdoms that oppressed you\\xa0 but ye have this day rejected your god who himself saveth you out of all your calamities and your distresses and ye have said unto him nay but set a king over us now therefore present yourselves before the lord by your tribes and by your thousands\\xa0 so samuel brought all the tribes of israel near and the tribe of benjamin was taken\\xa0 and he brought the tribe of benjamin near by their families and the family of the matrites was taken and saul the son of kish was taken but when they sought him he could not be found\\xa0 therefore they asked of the lord further is there yet a man come hither s and the lord answered behold he hath hid himself among the baggage\\xa0 and they ran and fetched him thence and when he stood among the people he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward\\xa0 and samuel said to all the people see ye him whom the lord hath chosen that there is none like him among all the people and all the people shouted and said long live the king s\\xa0 then samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom and wrote it in a book and laid it up before the lord and samuel sent all the people away every man to his house\\xa0 and saul also went to his house to gibeah and there went with him the men of valour whose hearts god had touched\\xa0 but certain base fellows said how shall this man save us and they despised him and brought him no present but he was as one that held his peace \\xa0 then nahash the ammonite came up and encamped against jabeshgilead and all the men of jabesh said unto nahash make a covenant with us and we will serve thee\\xa0 and nahash the ammonite said unto them on this condition will i make it with you that all your right eyes be put out and i will lay it for a reproach upon all israel\\xa0 and the elders of jabesh said unto him give us seven days respite that we may send messengers unto all the borders of israel and then if there be none to deliver us we will come out to thee\\xa0 then came the messengers to gibeathshaul and spoke these words in the ears of the people and all the people lifted up their voice and wept\\xa0 and behold saul came following the oxen out of the field and saul said what aileth the people that they weep and they told him the words of the men of jabesh\\xa0 and the spirit of god came mightily upon saul when he heard those words and his anger was kindled greatly\\xa0 and he took a yoke of oxen and cut them in pieces and sent them throughout all the borders of israel by the hand of messengers saying whosoever cometh not forth after saul and after samuel so shall it be done unto his oxen and the dread of the lord fell on the people and they came out as one man\\xa0 and he numbered them in bezek and the children of israel were three hundred thousand and the men of judah thirty thousand\\xa0 and they said unto the messengers that came thus shall ye say unto the men of jabeshgilead tomorrow by the time the sun is hot ye shall have deliverance and the messengers came and told the men of jabesh and they were glad\\xa0 and the men of jabesh said tomorrow we will come out unto you and ye shall do with us all that seemeth good unto you s\\xa0 and it was so on the morrow that saul put the people in three companies and they came into the midst of the camp in the morning watch and smote the ammonites until the heat of the day and it came to pass that they that remained were scattered so that two of them were not left together\\xa0 and the people said unto samuel who is he that said shall saul reign over us bring the men that we may put them to death\\xa0 and saul said there shall not a man be put to death this day for today the lord hath wrought deliverance in israel\\xa0 then said samuel to the people come and let us go to gilgal and renew the kingdom there\\xa0 and all the people went to gilgal and there they made saul king before the lord in gilgal and there they sacrificed sacrifices of peaceofferings before the lord and there saul and all the men of israel rejoiced greatly \\xa0 and samuel said unto all israel behold i have hearkened unto your voice in all that ye said unto me and have made a king over you\\xa0 and now behold the king walketh before you and i am old and grayheaded and behold my sons are with you and i have walked before you from my youth unto this day\\xa0 here i am witness against me before the lord and before his anointed whose ox have i taken or whose ass have i taken or whom have i defrauded or whom have i oppressed or of whose hand have i taken a ransom to blind mine eyes therewith and i will restore it you\\xa0 and they said thou hast not defrauded us nor oppressed us neither hast thou taken aught of any mans hand\\xa0 and he said unto them the lord is witness against you and his anointed is witness this day that ye have not found aught in my hand and they said he is witness \\xa0 and samuel said unto the people it is the lord that made moses and aaron and that brought your fathers up out of the land of egypt\\xa0 now therefore stand still that i may plead with you before the lord concerning all the righteous acts of the lord which he did to you and to your fathers\\xa0 when jacob was come into egypt then your fathers cried unto the lord and the lord sent moses and aaron who brought forth your fathers out of egypt and they were made to dwell in this place\\xa0 but they forgot the lord their god and he gave them over into the hand of sisera captain of the host of hazor and into the hand of the philistines and into the hand of the king of moab and they fought against them\\xa0 and they cried unto the lord and said we have sinned because we have forsaken the lord and have served the baalim and the ashtaroth but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies and we will serve thee\\xa0 and the lord sent jerubbaal and bedan and jephthah and samuel and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side and ye dwelt in safety\\xa0 and when ye saw that nahash the king of the children of ammon came against you ye said unto me nay but a king shall reign over us when the lord your god was your king\\xa0 now therefore behold the king whom ye have chosen and whom ye have asked for and behold the lord hath set a king over you\\xa0 if ye will fear the lord and serve him and hearken unto his voice and not rebel against the commandment of the lord and both ye and also the king that reigneth over you be followers of the lord your god\\xa0 but if ye will not hearken unto the voice of the lord but rebel against the commandment of the lord then shall the hand of the lord be against you and against your fathers\\xa0 now therefore stand still and see this great thing which the lord will do before your eyes\\xa0 is it not wheat harvest today i will call unto the lord that he may send thunder and rain and ye shall know and see that your wickedness is great which ye have done in the sight of the lord in asking you a king s\\xa0 so samuel called unto the lord and the lord sent thunder and rain that day and all the people greatly feared the lord and samuel\\xa0 and all the people said unto samuel pray for thy servants unto the lord thy god that we die not for we have added unto all our sins this evil to ask us a king\\xa0 and samuel said unto the people fear not ye have indeed done all this evil yet turn not aside from following the lord but serve the lord with all your heart\\xa0 and turn ye not aside for then should ye go after vain things which cannot profit nor deliver for they are vain\\xa0 for the lord will not forsake his people for his great names sake because it hath pleased the lord to make you a people unto himself\\xa0 moreover as for me far be it from me that i should sin against the lord in ceasing to pray for you but i will instruct you in the good and the right way\\xa0 only fear the lord and serve him in truth with all your heart for consider how great things he hath done for you\\xa0 but if ye shall still do wickedly ye shall be swept away both ye and your king \\xa0 saul was  years old when he began to reign and two years he reigned over israel\\xa0 and saul chose him three thousand men of israel whereof two thousand were with saul in michmas and in the mount of bethel and a thousand were with jonathan in gibeathbenjamin and the rest of the people he sent every man to his tent\\xa0 and jonathan smote the garrison of the philistines that was in geba and the philistines heard of it and saul blew the horn throughout all the land saying let the hebrews hear\\xa0 and all israel heard say that saul had smitten the garrison of the philistines and that israel also had made himself odious with the philistines and the people were gathered together after saul to gilgal\\xa0 and the philistines assembled themselves together to fight with israel thirty thousand chariots and six thousand horsemen and people as the sand which is on the seashore in multitude and they came up and pitched in michmas eastward of bethaven\\xa0 when the men of israel saw that they were in a straitfor the people were distressedthen the people did hide themselves in caves and in thickets and in rocks and in holds and in pits\\xa0 now some of the hebrews had gone over the jordan to the land of gad and gilead but as for saul he was yet in gilgal and all the people followed him trembling\\xa0 and he tarried seven days according to the set time that samuel had appointed but samuel came not to gilgal and the people were scattered from him\\xa0 and saul said bring hither to me the burntoffering and the peaceofferings and he offered the burntoffering\\xa0 and it came to pass that as soon as he had made an end of offering the burntoffering behold samuel came and saul went out to meet him that he might salute him\\xa0 and samuel said what hast thou done and saul said because i saw that the people were scattered from me and that thou camest not within the days appointed and that the philistines assembled themselves together against michmas\\xa0 therefore said i now will the philistines come down upon me to gilgal and i have not entreated the favour of the lord i forced myself therefore and offered the burntoffering s\\xa0 and samuel said to saul thou hast done foolishly thou hast not kept the commandment of the lord thy god which he commanded thee for now would the lord have established thy kingdom upon israel for ever\\xa0 but now thy kingdom shall not continue the lord hath sought him a man after his own heart and the lord hath appointed him to be prince over his people because thou hast not kept that which the lord commanded thee s\\xa0 and samuel arose and got him up from gilgal unto gibeathbenjamin and saul numbered the people that were present with him about six hundred men\\xa0 and saul and jonathan his son and the people that were present with them abode in gibeathbenjamin but the philistines encamped in michmas\\xa0 and the spoilers came out of the camp of the philistines in three companies one company turned unto the way that leadeth to ophrah unto the land of shual\\xa0 and another company turned the way to bethhoron and another company turned the way of the border that looketh down upon the valley of zeboim toward the wilderness s\\xa0 now there was no smith found throughout all the land of israel for the philistines said lest the hebrews make them swords or spears\\xa0 but all the israelites went down to the philistines to sharpen every man his plowshare and his coulter and his axe and his mattock\\xa0 and the price of the filing was a pim for the mattocks and for the coulters and for the forks with three t',\n",
       "  'eeth and for the axes and to set the goads\\xa0 so it came to pass in the day of battle that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that were with saul and jonathan but with saul and with jonathan his son was there found\\xa0 and the garrison of the philistines went out unto the pass of michmas s\\xa0 now it fell upon a day that jonathan the son of saul said unto the young man that bore his armour come and let us go over to the philistines garrison that is on yonder side but he told not his father\\xa0 and saul tarried in the uttermost part of gibeah under the pomegranatetree which is in migron and the people that were with him were about six hundred men\\xa0 and ahijah the son of ahitub ichabods brother the son of phinehas the son of eli the priest of the lord in shiloh wearing an ephod and the people knew not that jonathan was gone\\xa0 and between the passes by which jonathan sought to go over unto the philistines garrison there was a rocky crag on the one side and a rocky crag on the other side and the name of the one was bozez and the name of the other seneh\\xa0 the one crag rose up on the north in front of michmas and the other on the south in front of geba s\\xa0 and jonathan said to the young man that bore his armour come and let us go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised it may be that the lord will work for us for there is no restraint to the lord to save by many or by few\\xa0 and his armourbearer said unto him do all that is in thy heart turn thee behold i am with thee according to thy heart s\\xa0 then said jonathan behold we will pass over unto the men and we will disclose ourselves unto them\\xa0 if they say thus unto us tarry until we come to you then we will stand still in our place and will not go up unto them\\xa0 but if they say thus come up unto us then we will go up for the lord hath delivered them into our hand and this shall be the sign unto us\\xa0 and both of them disclosed themselves unto the garrison of the philistines and the philistines said behold hebrews coming forth out of the holes where they hid themselves\\xa0 and the men of the garrison spoke to jonathan and his armourbearer and said come up to us and we will show you a thing p\\xa0and jonathan said unto his armourbearer come up after me for the lord hath delivered them into the hand of israel\\xa0 and jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet and his armourbearer after him and they fell before jonathan and his armourbearer slew them after him\\xa0 and that first slaughter which jonathan and his armourbearer made was about twenty men within as it were half a furrows length in an acre of land\\xa0 and there was a trembling in the camp in the field and among all the people the garrison and the spoilers they also trembled and the earth quaked so it grew into a terror from god\\xa0 and the watchmen of saul in gibeathbenjamin looked and behold the multitude melted away and they went hither and thither \\xa0 then said saul unto the people that were with him number now and see who is gone from us and when they had numbered behold jonathan and his armourbearer were not there\\xa0 and saul said unto ahijah bring hither the ark of god for the ark of god was there at that time with the children of israel\\xa0 and it came to pass while saul talked unto the priest that the tumult that was in the camp of the philistines went on and increased p\\xa0and saul said unto the priest withdraw thy hand\\xa0 and saul and all the people that were with him were gathered together and came to the battle and behold every mans sword was against his fellow and there was a very great discomfiture\\xa0 now the hebrews that were with the philistines as beforetime and that went up with them into the camp round about even they also turned to be with the israelites that were with saul and jonathan\\xa0 likewise all the men of israel that had hid themselves in the hillcountry of ephraim when they heard that the philistines fled even they also followed hard after them in the battle\\xa0 so the lord saved israel that day and the battle passed on as far as bethaven\\xa0 and the men of israel were distressed that day but saul adjured the people saying cursed be the man that eateth any food until it be evening and i be avenged on mine enemies so none of the people tasted food s\\xa0 and all the people came into the forest and there was honey upon the ground\\xa0 and when the people were come unto the forest behold a flow of honey but no man put his hand to his mouth for the people feared the oath\\xa0 but jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath and he put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand and dipped it in the honeycomb and put his hand to his mouth and his eyes brightened\\xa0 then answered one of the people and said thy father straitly charged the people with an oath saying cursed be the man that eateth food this day and the people are faint\\xa0 then said jonathan my father hath troubled the land see i pray you how mine eyes are brightened because i tasted a little of this honey\\xa0 how much more if haply the people had eaten freely today of the spoil of their enemies which they found had there not been then a much greater slaughter among the philistines\\xa0 and they smote of the philistines that day from michmas to aijalon and the people were very faint\\xa0 and the people flew upon the spoil and took sheep and oxen and calves and slew them on the ground and the people did eat them with the blood\\xa0 then they told saul saying behold the people sin against the lord in that they eat with the blood and he said ye have dealt treacherously roll a great stone unto me this day\\xa0 and saul said disperse yourselves among the people and say unto them bring me hither every man his ox and every man his sheep and slay them here and eat and sin not against the lord in eating with the blood and all the people brought every man his ox with him that night and slew them there\\xa0 and saul built an altar unto the lord the same was the first altar that he built unto the lord \\xa0 and saul said let us go down after the philistines by night and spoil them until the morning light and let us not leave a man of them and they said do whatsoever seemeth good unto thee s then said the priest let us draw near hither unto god\\xa0 and saul asked counsel of god shall i go down after the philistines wilt thou deliver them into the hand of israel but he answered him not that day\\xa0 and saul said draw nigh hither all ye chiefs of the people and know and see wherein this sin hath been this day\\xa0 for as the lord liveth who saveth israel though it be in jonathan my son he shall surely die but there was not a man among all the people that answered him\\xa0 then said he unto all israel be ye on one side and i and jonathan my son will be on the other side and the people said unto saul do what seemeth good unto thee s\\xa0 therefore saul said unto the lord the god of israel declare the right and jonathan and saul were taken by lot but the people escaped\\xa0 and saul said cast lots between me and jonathan my son and jonathan was taken\\xa0 then saul said to jonathan tell me what thou hast done and jonathan told him and said i did certainly taste a little honey with the end of the rod that was in my hand here am i i will die s\\xa0 and saul said god do so and more also thou shalt surely die jonathan\\xa0 and the people said unto saul shall jonathan die who hath wrought this great salvation in israel far from it as the lord liveth there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground for he hath wrought with god this day so the people rescued jonathan that he died not s\\xa0 then saul went up from following the philistines and the philistines went to their own place\\xa0 so saul took the kingdom over israel and fought against all his enemies on every side against moab and against the children of ammon and against edom and against the kings of zobah and against the philistines and whithersoever he turned himself he put them to the worse\\xa0 and he did valiantly and smote the amalekites and delivered israel out of the hands of them that spoiled them \\xa0 now the sons of saul were jonathan and ishvi and malchishua and the names of his two daughters were these the name of the firstborn merab and the name of the younger michal\\xa0 and the name of sauls wife was ahinoam the daughter of ahimaaz and the name of the captain of his host was abner the son of ner sauls uncle\\xa0 and kish was the father of saul and ner the father of abner was the son of abiel s\\xa0 and there was sore war against the philistines all the days of saul and when saul saw any mighty man or any valiant man he took him unto him \\xa0 and samuel said unto saul the lord sent me to anoint thee to be king over his people over israel now therefore hearken thou unto the voice of the words of the lord s\\xa0 thus saith the lord of hosts i remember that which amalek did to israel how he set himself against him in the way when he came up out of egypt\\xa0 now go and smite amalek and utterly destroy all that they have and spare them not but slay both man and woman infant and suckling ox and sheep camel and ass s\\xa0 and saul summoned the people and numbered them in telaim two hundred thousand footmen and ten thousand men of judah\\xa0 and saul came to the city of amalek and lay in wait in the valley\\xa0 and saul said unto the kenites go depart get you down from among the amalekites lest i destroy you with them for ye showed kindness to all the children of israel when they came up out of egypt so the kenites departed from among the amalekites\\xa0 and saul smote the amalekites from havilah as thou goest to shur that is in front of egypt\\xa0 and he took agag the king of the amalekites alive and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword\\xa0 but saul and the people spared agag and the best of the sheep and of the oxen even the young of the second birth and the lambs and all that was good and would not utterly destroy them but every thing that was of no account and feeble that they destroyed utterly \\xa0 then came the word of the lord unto samuel saying\\xa0 it repenteth me that i have set up saul to be king for he is turned back from following me and hath not performed my commandments and it grieved samuel and he cried unto the lord all night\\xa0 and samuel rose early to meet saul in the morning and it was told samuel saying saul came to carmel and behold he is setting him up a monument and is gone about and passed on and gone down to gilgal\\xa0 and samuel came to saul and saul said unto him blessed be thou of the lord i have performed the commandment of the lord\\xa0 and samuel said what meaneth then this bleating of the sheep in mine ears and the lowing of the oxen which i hear\\xa0 and saul said they have brought them from the amalekites for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen to sacrifice unto the lord thy god and the rest we have utterly destroyed \\xa0 then samuel said unto saul stay and i will tell thee what the lord hath said to me this night and he said unto him say on s\\xa0 and samuel said though thou be little in thine own sight art thou not head of the tribes of israel and the lord anointed thee king over israel\\xa0 and the lord sent thee on a journey and said go and utterly destroy the sinners the amalekites and fight against them until they be consumed\\xa0 wherefore then didst thou not hearken to the voice of the lord but didst fly upon the spoil and didst that which was evil in the sight of the lord s\\xa0 and saul said unto samuel yea i have hearkened to the voice of the lord and have gone the way which the lord sent me and have brought agag the king of amalek and have utterly destroyed the amaleki',\n",
       "  'tes\\xa0 but the people took of the spoil sheep and oxen the chief of the devoted things to sacrifice unto the lord thy god in gilgal s\\xa0 and samuel said hath the lord as great delight in burntofferings and sacrifices as in hearkening to the voice of the lord behold to obey is better than sacrifice and to hearken than the fat of rams\\xa0 for rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft and stubbornness is as idolatry and teraphim because thou hast rejected the word of the lord he hath also rejected thee from being king s\\xa0 and saul said unto samuel i have sinned for i have transgressed the commandment of the lord and thy words because i feared the people and hearkened to their voice\\xa0 now therefore i pray thee pardon my sin and return with me that i may worship the lord\\xa0 and samuel said unto saul i will not return with thee for thou hast rejected the word of the lord and the lord hath rejected thee from being king over israel s\\xa0 and as samuel turned about to go away he laid hold upon the skirt of his robe and it rent s\\xa0 and samuel said unto him the lord hath rent the kingdom of israel from thee this day and hath given it to a neighbour of thine that is better than thou s\\xa0 and also the glory of israel will not lie nor repent for he is not a man that he should repent\\xa0 then he said i have sinned yet honour me now i pray thee before the elders of my people and before israel and return with me that i may worship the lord thy god\\xa0 so samuel returned after saul and saul worshipped the lord s\\xa0 then said samuel bring ye hither to me agag the king of the amalekites and agag came unto him in chains and agag said surely the bitterness of death is at hand s\\xa0 and samuel said as thy sword hath made women childless so shall thy mother be childless among women and samuel hewed agag in pieces before the lord in gilgal s\\xa0 then samuel went to ramah and saul went up to his house to gibeathshaul\\xa0 and samuel never beheld saul again until the day of his death for samuel mourned for saul and the lord repented that he had made saul king over israel \\xa0 and the lord said unto samuel how long wilt thou mourn for saul seeing i have rejected him from being king over israel fill thy horn with oil and go i will send thee to jesse the bethlehemite for i have provided me a king among his sons\\xa0 and samuel said how can i go if saul hear it he will kill me and the lord said take a heifer with thee and say i am come to sacrifice to the lord\\xa0 and call jesse to the sacrifice and i will tell thee what thou shalt do and thou shalt anoint unto me him whom i name unto thee\\xa0 and samuel did that which the lord spoke and came to bethlehem and the elders of the city came to meet him trembling and said comest thou peaceably\\xa0 and he said peaceably i am come to sacrifice unto the lord sanctify yourselves and come with me to the sacrifice and he sanctified jesse and his sons and called them to the sacrifice\\xa0 and it came to pass when they were come that he beheld eliab and said surely the lords anointed is before him s\\xa0 but the lord said unto samuel look not on his countenance or on the height of his stature because i have rejected him for it is not as man seeth for man looketh on the outward appearance but the lord looketh on the heart\\xa0 then jesse called abinadab and made him pass before samuel and he said neither hath the lord chosen this\\xa0 then jesse made shammah to pass by and he said neither hath the lord chosen this\\xa0 and jesse made seven of his sons to pass before samuel and samuel said unto jesse the lord hath not chosen these\\xa0 and samuel said unto jesse are here all thy children and he said there remaineth yet the youngest and behold he keepeth the sheep and samuel said unto jesse send and fetch him for we will not sit down till he come hither\\xa0 and he sent and brought him in now he was ruddy and withal of beautiful eyes and goodly to look upon p\\xa0and the lord said arise anoint him for this is he\\xa0 then samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his brethren and the spirit of the lord came mightily upon david from that day forward so samuel rose up and went to ramah\\xa0 now the spirit of the lord had departed from saul and an evil spirit from the lord terrified him\\xa0 and sauls servants said unto him behold now an evil spirit from god terrifieth thee\\xa0 let our lord now command thy servants that are before thee to seek out a man who is a skilful player on the harp and it shall be when the evil spirit from god cometh upon thee that he shall play with his hand and thou shalt be well \\xa0 and saul said unto his servants provide me now a man that can play well and bring him to me\\xa0 then answered one of the young men and said behold i have seen a son of jesse the bethlehemite that is skilful in playing and a mighty man of valour and a man of war and prudent in affairs and a comely person and the lord is with him\\xa0 wherefore saul sent messengers unto jesse and said send me david thy son who is with the sheep\\xa0 and jesse took an ass laden with bread and a bottle of wine and a kid and sent them by david his son unto saul\\xa0 and david came to saul and stood before him and he loved him greatly and he became his armourbearer\\xa0 and saul sent to jesse saying let david i pray thee stand before me for he hath found favour in my sight\\xa0 and it came to pass when the  spirit from god was upon saul that david took the harp and played with his hand so saul found relief and it was well with him and the evil spirit departed from him \\xa0 now the philistines gathered together their armies to battle and they were gathered together at socoh which belongeth to judah and pitched between socoh and azekah in ephesdammim\\xa0 and saul and the men of israel were gathered together and pitched in the vale of elah and set the battle in array against the philistines\\xa0 and the philistines stood on the mountain on the one side and israel stood on the mountain on the other side and there was a valley between them\\xa0 and there went out a champion from the camp of the philistines named goliath of gath whose height was six cubits and a span\\xa0 and he had a helmet of brass upon his head and he was clad with a coat of mail and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of brass\\xa0 and he had greaves of brass upon his legs and a javelin of brass between his shoulders\\xa0 and the shaft of his spear was like a weavers beam and his spears head weighed six hundred shekels of iron and his shieldbearer went before him\\xa0 and he stood and cried unto the armies of israel and said unto them why do ye come out to set your battle in array am not i a philistine and ye servants to saul choose you a man for you and let him come down to me\\xa0 if he be able to fight with me and kill me then will we be your servants but if i prevail against him and kill him then shall ye be our servants and serve us\\xa0 and the philistine said i do taunt the armies of israel this day give me a man that we may fight together\\xa0 and when saul and all israel heard those words of the philistine they were dismayed and greatly afraid \\xa0 now david was the son of that ephrathite of bethlehem in judah whose name was jesse and he had eight sons and the man was an old man in the days of saul stricken in years among men\\xa0 and the three eldest sons of jesse had gone after saul to the battle and the names of his three sons that went to the battle were eliab the firstborn and next unto him abinadab and the third shammah\\xa0 and david was the youngest and the three eldest followed saul s\\xa0 now david went to and fro from saul to feed his fathers sheep at bethlehem\\xa0 and the philistine drew near morning and evening and presented himself forty days \\xa0 and jesse said unto david his son take now for thy brethren an ephah of this parched corn and these ten loaves and carry them quickly to the camp to thy brethren\\xa0 and bring these ten cheeses unto the captain of their thousand and to thy brethren shalt thou bring greetings and take their pledge\\xa0 now saul and they and all the men of israel are in the vale of elah fighting with the philistines s\\xa0 and david rose up early in the morning and left the sheep with a keeper and took and went as jesse had commanded him and he came to the barricade as the host which was going forth to the fight shouted for the battle\\xa0 and israel and the philistines put the battle in array army against army\\xa0 and david left his baggage in the hand of the keeper of the baggage and ran to the army and came and greeted his brethren\\xa0 and as he talked with them behold there came up the champion the philistine of gath goliath by name out of the ranks of the philistines and spoke according to the same words and david heard them\\xa0 and all the men of israel when they saw the man fled from him and were sore afraid\\xa0 and the men of israel said have ye seen this man that is come up surely to taunt israel is he come up and it shall be that the man who killeth him the king will enrich him with great riches and will give him his daughter and make his fathers house free in israel \\xa0 and david spoke to the men that stood by him saying what shall be done to the man that killeth this philistine and taketh away the taunt from israel for who is this uncircumcised philistine that he should have taunted the armies of the living god\\xa0 and the people answered him after this manner saying so shall it be done to the man that killeth him\\xa0 and eliab his eldest brother heard when he spoke unto the men and eliabs anger was kindled against david and he said why art thou come down and with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the wilderness i know thy presumptuousness and the naughtiness of thy heart for thou art come down that thou mightest see the battle\\xa0 and david said what have i now done was it not but a word\\xa0 and he turned away from him toward another and spoke after the same manner and the people answered him after the former manner\\xa0 and when the words were heard which david spoke they rehearsed them before saul and he was taken to him\\xa0 and david said to saul let no mans heart fail within him thy servant will go and fight with this philistine\\xa0 and saul said to david thou art not able to go against this philistine to fight with him for thou art but a youth and he a man of war from his youth s\\xa0 and david said unto saul thy servant kept his fathers sheep and when there came a lion or a bear and took a lamb out of the flock\\xa0 i went out after him and smote him and delivered it out of his mouth and when he arose against me i caught him by his beard and smote him and slew him\\xa0 thy servant smote both the lion and the bear and this uncircumcised philistine shall be as one of them seeing he hath taunted the armies of the living god s\\xa0 and david said the lord that delivered me out of the paw of the lion and out of the paw of the bear he will deliver me out of the hand of this philistine s and saul said unto david go and the lord shall be with thee\\xa0 and saul clad david with his apparel and he put a helmet of brass upon his head and he clad him with a coat of mail\\xa0 and david girded his sword upon his apparel and he essayed to go for he had not tried it and david said unto saul i cannot go with these for i have not tried them and david put them off him\\xa0 and he took his staff in his hand and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook and put them in the shepherds bag which he had even in his scrip and his sling was in his hand and he drew near to the philistine\\xa0 and the philistine came nearer and nearer unto david and the man that bore the shield went before him\\xa0 and when the philistine looked about and saw david he disdained him for he was ',\n",
       "  'but a youth and ruddy and withal of a fair countenance\\xa0 and the philistine said unto david am i a dog that thou comest to me with staves and the philistine cursed david by his god\\xa0 and the philistine said to david come to me and i will give thy flesh unto the fowls of the air and to the beasts of the field s\\xa0 then said david to the philistine thou comest to me with a sword and with a spear and with a javelin but i come to thee in the name of the lord of hosts the god of the armies of israel whom thou hast taunted\\xa0 this day will the lord deliver thee into my hand and i will smite thee and take thy head from off thee and i will give the carcasses of the host of the philistines this day unto the fowls of the air and to the wild beasts of the earth that all the earth may know that there is a god in israel\\xa0 and that all this assembly may know that the lord saveth not with sword and spear for the battle is the lords and he will give you into our hand s\\xa0 and it came to pass when the philistine arose and came and drew nigh to meet david that david hastened and ran toward the army to meet the philistine\\xa0 and david put his hand in his bag and took thence a stone and slung it and smote the philistine in his forehead and the stone sank into his forehead and he fell upon his face to the earth\\xa0 so david prevailed over the philistine with a sling and with a stone and smote the philistine and slew him but there was no sword in the hand of david\\xa0 and david ran and stood over the philistine and took his sword and drew it out of the sheath thereof and slew him and cut off his head therewith and when the philistines saw that their mighty man was dead they fled\\xa0 and the men of israel and of judah arose and shouted and pursued the philistines until thou comest to gai and to the gates of ekron and the wounded of the philistines fell down by the way to shaaraim even unto gath and unto ekron\\xa0 and the children of israel returned from chasing after the philistines and they spoiled their camp\\xa0 and david took the head of the philistine and brought it to jerusalem but he put his armour in his tent s\\xa0 and when saul saw david go forth against the philistine he said unto abner the captain of the host abner whose son is this youth and abner said as thy soul liveth o king i cannot tell\\xa0 and the king said inquire thou whose son the stripling is s\\xa0 and as david returned from the slaughter of the philistine abner took him and brought him before saul with the head of the philistine in his hand\\xa0 and saul said to him whose son art thou thou young man and david answered i am the son of thy servant jesse the bethlehemite\\xa0 and it came to pass when he had made an end of speaking unto saul that the soul of jonathan was knit with the soul of david and jonathan loved him as his own soul\\xa0 and saul took him that day and would let him go no more home to his fathers house\\xa0 then jonathan made a covenant with david because he loved him as his own soul\\xa0 and jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him and gave it to david and his apparel even to his sword and to his bow and to his girdle\\xa0 and david went out whithersoever saul sent him he had good success and saul set him over the men of war and it was good in the sight of all the people and also in the sight of sauls servants \\xa0 and it came to pass as they came when david returned from the slaughter of the philistine that the women came out of all the cities of israel singing and dancing to meet king saul with timbrels with joy and with threestringed instruments\\xa0 and the women sang one to another in their play and said saul hath slain his thousands and david his ten thousands\\xa0 and saul was very wroth and this saying displeased him and he said they have ascribed unto david ten thousands and to me they have ascribed but thousands and all he lacketh is the kingdom\\xa0 and saul eyed david from that day and forward s\\xa0 and it came to pass on the morrow that an evil spirit from god came mightily upon saul and he raved in the midst of the house and david played with his hand as he did day by day and saul had his spear in his hand\\xa0 and saul cast the spear for he said i will smite david even to the wall and david stepped aside out of his presence twice\\xa0 and saul was afraid of david because the lord was with him and was departed from saul\\xa0 therefore saul removed him from him and made him his captain over a thousand and he went out and came in before the people s\\xa0 and david had great success in all his ways and the lord was with him\\xa0 and when saul saw that he had great success he stood in awe of him\\xa0 but all israel and judah loved david for he went out and came in before them \\xa0 and saul said to david behold my elder daughter merab her will i give thee to wife only be thou valiant for me and fight the lords battles for saul said let not my hand be upon him but let the hand of the philistines be upon him s\\xa0 and david said unto saul who am i and what is my life or my fathers family in israel that i should be soninlaw to the king\\xa0 but it came to pass at the time when merab sauls daughter should have been given to david that she was given unto adriel the meholathite to wife\\xa0 and michal sauls daughter loved david and they told saul and the thing pleased him\\xa0 and saul said i will give him her that she may be a snare to him and that the hand of the philistines may be against him wherefore saul said to david thou shalt this day be my soninlaw through the one of the twain\\xa0 and saul commanded his servants speak with david secretly and say behold the king hath delight in thee and all his servants love thee now therefore be the kings soninlaw\\xa0 and sauls servants spoke those words in the ears of david and david said seemeth it to you a light thing to be the kings soninlaw seeing that i am a poor man and lightly esteemed\\xa0 and the servants of saul told him saying on this manner spoke david\\xa0 and saul said thus shall ye say to david the king desireth not any dowry but a hundred foreskins of the philistines to be avenged of the kings enemies for saul thought to make david fall by the hand of the philistines\\xa0 and when his servants told david these words it pleased david well to be the kings soninlaw and the days were not expired\\xa0 and david arose and went he and his men and slew of the philistines two hundred men and david brought their foreskins and they gave them in full number to the king that he might be the kings soninlaw and saul gave him michal his daughter to wife s\\xa0 and saul saw and knew that the lord was with david and michal sauls daughter loved him\\xa0 and saul was yet the more afraid of david and saul was davids enemy continually \\xa0 then the princes of the philistines went forth and it came to pass as often as they went forth that david prospered more than all the servants of saul so that his name was much set by s\\xa0 and saul spoke to jonathan his son and to all his servants that they should slay david but jonathan sauls son delighted much in david\\xa0 and jonathan told david saying saul my father seeketh to slay thee now therefore i pray thee take heed to thyself in the morning and abide in a secret place and hide thyself\\xa0 and i will go out and stand beside my father in the field where thou art and i will speak with my father of thee and if i see aught i will tell thee s\\xa0 and jonathan spoke good of david unto saul his father and said unto him let not the king sin against his servant against david because he hath not sinned against thee and because his work hath been very good towards thee\\xa0 for he put his life in his hand and smote the philistine and the lord wrought a great victory for all israel thou sawest it and didst rejoice wherefore then wilt thou sin against innocent blood to slay david without a cause\\xa0 and saul hearkened unto the voice of jonathan and saul swore as the lord liveth he shall not be put to death\\xa0 and jonathan called david and jonathan told him all those things and jonathan brought david to saul and he was in his presence as beforetime s\\xa0 and there was war again and david went out and fought with the philistines and slew them with a great slaughter and they fled before him\\xa0 and an evil spirit from the lord was upon saul as he sat in his house with his spear in his hand and david was playing with his hand\\xa0 and saul sought to smite david even to the wall with the spear but he slipped away out of sauls presence and he smote the spear into the wall and david fled and escaped that night \\xa0 and saul sent messengers unto davids house to watch him and to slay him in the morning and michal davids wife told him saying if thou save not thy life tonight tomorrow thou shalt be slain\\xa0 so michal let david down through the window and he went and fled and escaped\\xa0 and michal took the teraphim and laid it in the bed and put a quilt of goats hair at the head thereof and covered it with a cloth s\\xa0 and when saul sent messengers to take david she said he is sick s\\xa0 and saul sent the messengers to see david saying bring him up to me in the bed that i may slay him\\xa0 and when the messengers came in behold the teraphim was in the bed with the quilt of goats hair at the head thereof s\\xa0 and saul said unto michal why hast thou deceived me thus and let mine enemy go that he is escaped and michal answered saul he said unto me let me go why should i kill thee\\xa0 now david fled and escaped and came to samuel to ramah and told him all that saul had done to him and he and samuel went and dwelt in naioth\\xa0 and it was told saul saying behold david is at naioth in ramah\\xa0 and saul sent messengers to take david and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying and samuel standing as head over them the spirit of god came upon the messengers of saul and they also prophesied\\xa0 and when it was told saul he sent other messengers and they also prophesied s and saul sent messengers again the third time and they also prophesied\\xa0 then went he also to ramah and came to the great cistern that is in secu and he asked and said where are samuel and david and one said behold they are at naioth in ramah\\xa0 and he went thither to naioth in ramah and the spirit of god came upon him also and he went on and prophesied until he came to naioth in ramah\\xa0 and he also stripped off his clothes and he also prophesied before samuel and lay down naked all that day and all that night wherefore they say is saul also among the prophets \\xa0 and david fled from naioth in ramah and came and said before jonathan what have i done what is mine iniquity and what is my sin before thy father that he seeketh my life\\xa0 and he said unto him far from it thou shalt not die behold my father doeth nothing either great or small but that he discloseth it unto me and why should my father hide this thing from me it is not so\\xa0 and david swore moreover and said thy father knoweth well that i have found favour in thine eyes and he saith let not jonathan know this lest he be grieved but truly as the lord liveth and as thy soul liveth there is but a step between me and death\\xa0 then said jonathan unto david what doth thy soul desire that i should do it for thee \\xa0 and david said unto jonathan behold tomorrow is the new moon when i should sit with the king to eat so let me go that i may hide myself in the field unto the third day at even\\xa0 if thy father miss me at all then say david earnestly asked leave of me that he might run to bethlehem his city for it is the yearly sacrifice there for all the family\\xa0 if he say thus it is well thy servant shall have peace but if he be wroth then know that evil is determined by him\\xa0 therefore deal ki',\n",
       "  'ndly with thy servant for thou hast brought thy servant into a covenant of the lord with thee but if there be in me iniquity slay me thyself for why shouldest thou bring me to thy father \\xa0 and jonathan said far be it from thee for if i should at all know that evil were determined by my father to come upon thee then would not i tell it thee s\\xa0 then said david to jonathan who shall tell me if perchance thy father answer thee roughly s\\xa0 and jonathan said unto david come and let us go out into the field and they went out both of them into the field s\\xa0 and jonathan said unto david the lord the god of israelwhen i have sounded my father about this time tomorrow or the third day behold if there be good toward david shall i not then send unto thee and disclose it unto thee\\xa0 the lord do so to jonathan and more also should it please my father to do thee evil if i disclose it not unto thee and send thee away that thou mayest go in peace and the lord be with thee as he hath been with my father\\xa0 and thou shalt not only while yet i live show me the kindness of the lord that i die not\\xa0 but also thou shalt not cut off thy kindness from my house for ever no not when the lord hath cut off the enemies of david every one from the face of the earth\\xa0 so jonathan made a covenant with the house of david the lord even require it at the hand of davids enemies\\xa0 and jonathan caused david to swear again for the love that he had to him for he loved him as he loved his own soul s\\xa0 and jonathan said unto him tomorrow is the new moon and thou wilt be missed thy seat will be empty\\xa0 and in the third day thou shalt hide thyself well and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself in the day of work and shalt remain by the stone ezel\\xa0 and i will shoot three arrows to the sideward as though i shot at a mark\\xa0 and behold i will send the lad go find the arrows if i say unto the lad behold the arrows are on this side of thee take them and come for there is peace to thee and no hurt as the lord liveth\\xa0 but if i say thus unto the boy behold the arrows are beyond thee go thy way for the lord hath sent thee away\\xa0 and as touching the matter which i and thou have spoken of behold the lord is between me and thee for ever s\\xa0 so david hid himself in the field and when the new moon was come the king sat him down to the meal to eat\\xa0 and the king sat upon his seat as at other times even upon the seat by the wall and jonathan stood up and abner sat by sauls side but davids place was empty\\xa0 nevertheless saul spoke not any thing that day for he thought something hath befallen him he is unclean surely he is not clean s\\xa0 and it came to pass on the morrow after the new moon which was the second day that davids place was empty p\\xa0and saul said unto jonathan his son wherefore cometh not the son of jesse to the meal neither yesterday nor today\\xa0 and jonathan answered saul david earnestly asked leave of me to go to bethlehem\\xa0 and he said let me go i pray thee for our family hath a sacrifice in the city and my brother he hath commanded me and now if i have found favour in thine eyes let me get away i pray thee and see my brethren therefore he is not come unto the kings table s\\xa0 then sauls anger was kindled against jonathan and he said unto him thou son of perverse rebellion do not i know that thou hast chosen the son of jesse to thine own shame and unto the shame of thy mothers nakedness\\xa0 for as long as the son of jesse liveth upon the earth thou shalt not be established nor thy kingdom wherefore now send and fetch him unto me for he deserveth to die s\\xa0 and jonathan answered saul his father and said unto him wherefore should he be put to death what hath he done\\xa0 and saul cast his spear at him to smite him whereby jonathan knew that it was determined of his father to put david to death s\\xa0 so jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger and did eat no food the second day of the month for he was grieved for david and because his father had put him to shame s\\xa0 and it came to pass in the morning that jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with david and a little lad with him\\xa0 and he said unto his lad run find now the arrows which i shoot and as the lad ran he shot an arrow beyond him\\xa0 and when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which jonathan had shot jonathan cried after the lad and said is not the arrow beyond thee\\xa0 and jonathan cried after the lad make speed hasten stay not and jonathans lad gathered up the arrows and came to his master\\xa0 but the lad knew not any thing only jonathan and david knew the matter s\\xa0 and jonathan gave his weapons unto his lad and said unto him go carry them to the city\\xa0 and as soon as the lad was gone david arose out of a place toward the south and fell on his face to the ground and bowed down three times and they kissed one another and wept one with another until david exceeded\\xa0 and jonathan said to david go in peace forasmuch as we have sworn both of us in the name of the lord saying the lord shall be between me and thee and between my seed and thy seed for ever \\xa0 and he arose and departed and jonathan went into the city\\xa0 then came david to nob to ahimelech the priest and ahimelech came to meet david trembling and said unto him why art thou alone and no man with thee\\xa0 and david said unto ahimelech the priest the king hath commanded me a business and hath said unto me let no man know any thing of the business whereabout i send thee and what i have commanded thee and the young men have i appointed to such and such a place\\xa0 now therefore what is under thy hand five loaves of bread give them in my hand or whatsoever there is present\\xa0 and the priest answered david and said there is no common bread under my hand but there is holy bread if only the young men have kept themselves from women \\xa0 and david answered the priest and said unto him of a truth women have been kept from us about these three days when i came out the vessels of the young men were holy though it was but a common journey how much more then today when there shall be holy bread in their vessels\\xa0 so the priest gave him holy bread for there was no bread there but the showbread that was taken from before the lord to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away\\xa0 now a certain man of the servants of saul was there that day detained before the lord and his name was doeg the edomite the chiefest of the herdmen that belonged to saul\\xa0 and david said unto ahimelech and is there peradventure here under thy hand spear or sword for i have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me because the kings business required haste s\\xa0 and the priest said the sword of goliath the philistine whom thou slewest in the vale of elah behold it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod if thou wilt take that take it for there is no other save that here s and david said there is none like that give it me\\xa0 and david arose and fled that day for fear of saul and went to achish the king of gath\\xa0 and the servants of achish said unto him is not this david the king of the land did they not sing one to another of him in dances saying saul hath slain his thousands and david his ten thousands\\xa0 and david laid up these words in his heart and was sore afraid of achish the king of gath\\xa0 and he changed his demeanour before them and feigned himself mad in their hands and scrabbled on the doors of the gate and let his spittle fall down upon his beard s\\xa0 then said achish unto his servants lo when ye see a man that is mad wherefore do ye bring him to me\\xa0 do i lack madmen that ye have brought this fellow to play the madman in my presence shall this fellow come into my house \\xa0 david therefore departed thence and escaped to the cave of adullam and when his brethren and all his fathers house heard it they went down thither to him\\xa0 and every one that was in distress and every one that was in debt and every one that was discontented gathered themselves unto him and he became captain over them and there were with him about four hundred men\\xa0 and david went thence to mizpeh of moab and he said unto the king of moab let my father and my mother i pray thee come forth and be with you till i know what god will do for me\\xa0 and he brought them before the king of moab and they dwelt with him all the while that david was in the stronghold s\\xa0 and the prophet gad said unto david abide not in the stronghold depart and get thee into the land of judah then david departed and came into the forest of hereth s\\xa0 and saul heard that david was discovered and the men that were with him now saul was sitting in gibeah under the tamarisktree in ramah with his spear in his hand and all his servants were standing about him\\xa0 and saul said unto his servants that stood about him hear now ye benjamites will the son of jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards will he make you all captains of thousands and captains of hundreds\\xa0 that all of you have conspired against me and there was none that disclosed it to me when my son made a league with the son of jesse and there is none of you that is sorry for me or discloseth unto me that my son hath stirred up my servant against me to lie in wait as at this day s\\xa0 then answered doeg the edomite who was set over the servants of saul and said i saw the son of jesse coming to nob to ahimelech the son of ahitub\\xa0 and he inquired of the lord for him and gave him victuals and gave him the sword of goliath the philistine\\xa0 then the king sent to call ahimelech the priest the son of ahitub and all his fathers house the priests that were in nob and they came all of them to the king s\\xa0 and saul said hear now thou son of ahitub and he answered here i am my lord\\xa0 and saul said unto him why have ye conspired against me thou and the son of jesse in that thou hast given him bread and a sword and hast inquired of god for him that he should rise against me to lie in wait as at this day s\\xa0 then ahimelech answered the king and said and who among all thy servants is so trusted as david who is the kings soninlaw and giveth heed unto thy bidding and is honourable in thy house\\xa0 have i today begun to inquire of god for him be it far from me let not the king impute any thing unto his servant nor to all the house of my father for thy servant knoweth nothing of all this less or more\\xa0 and the king said thou shalt surely die ahimelech thou and all thy fathers house\\xa0 and the king said unto the guard that stood about him turn and slay the priests of the lord because their hand also is with david and because they knew that he fled and did not disclose it to me but the servants of the king would not put forth their hand to fall upon the priests of the lord s\\xa0 and the king said to doeg turn thou and fall upon the priests and doeg the edomite turned and he fell upon the priests and he slew on that day fourscore and five persons that did wear a linen ephod\\xa0 and nob the city of the priests smote he with the edge of the sword both men and women children and sucklings and oxen and asses and sheep with the edge of the sword\\xa0 and one of the sons of ahimelech the son of ahitub named abiathar escaped and fled after david\\xa0 and abiathar told david that saul had slain the lords priests\\xa0 and david said unto abiathar i knew on that day when doeg the edomite was there that he would surely tell saul i have brought about the death of all the persons of thy fathers house\\xa0 abide thou with me fear not for he that seeketh my life seeketh thy life for with me thou shalt be in safeguard s\\xa0 and they told david saying behold the philistines are fighting against keilah and t',\n",
       "  'hey rob the threshingfloors\\xa0 therefore david inquired of the lord saying shall i go and smite these philistines s and the lord said unto david go and smite the philistines and save keilah\\xa0 and davids men said unto him behold we are afraid here in judah how much more then if we go to keilah against the armies of the philistines s\\xa0 then david inquired of the lord yet again and the lord answered him and said arise go down to keilah for i will deliver the philistines into thy hand\\xa0 and david and his men went to keilah and fought with the philistines and brought away their cattle and slew them with a great slaughter so david saved the inhabitants of keilah s\\xa0 and it came to pass when abiathar the son of ahimelech fled to david to keilah that he came down with an ephod in his hand\\xa0 and it was told saul that david was come to keilah and saul said god hath delivered him into my hand for he is shut in by entering into a town that hath gates and bars\\xa0 and saul summoned all the people to war to go down to keilah to besiege david and his men\\xa0 and david knew that saul devised mischief against him and he said to abiathar the priest bring hither the ephod s\\xa0 then said david o lord the god of israel thy servant hath surely heard that saul seeketh to come to keilah to destroy the city for my sake\\xa0 will the men of keilah deliver me up into his hand will saul come down as thy servant hath heard o lord the god of israel i beseech thee tell thy servant s and the lord said he will come down s\\xa0 then said david will the men of keilah deliver up me and my men into the hand of saul and the lord said they will deliver thee up s\\xa0 then david and his men who were about six hundred arose and departed out of keilah and went whithersoever they could go and it was told saul that david was escaped from keilah and he forbore to go forth\\xa0 and david abode in the wilderness in the strongholds and remained in the hillcountry in the wilderness of ziph and saul sought him every day but god delivered him not into his hand\\xa0 and david saw that saul was come out to seek his life and david was in the wilderness of ziph in the wood s\\xa0 and jonathan sauls son arose and went to david into the wood and strengthened his hand in god\\xa0 and he said unto him fear not for the hand of saul my father shall not find thee and thou shalt be king over israel and i shall be next unto thee and that also saul my father knoweth\\xa0 and they two made a covenant before the lord and david abode in the wood and jonathan went to his house s\\xa0 then came up the ziphites to saul to gibeah saying doth not david hide himself with us in the strongholds in the wood in the hill of hachilah which is on the south of jeshimon\\xa0 now therefore o king come down according to all the desire of thy soul to come down and our part shall be to deliver him up into the kings hand\\xa0 and saul said blessed be ye of the lord for ye have had compassion on me\\xa0 go i pray you make yet more sure and know and see his place where his haunt is and who hath seen him there for it is told me that he dealeth very subtly\\xa0 see therefore and take knowledge of all the lurkingplaces where he hideth himself and come ye back to me with the certainty and i will go with you and it shall come to pass if he be in the land that i will search him out among all the thousands of judah\\xa0 and they arose and went to ziph before saul but david and his men were in the wilderness of maon in the arabah on the south of jeshimon\\xa0 and saul and his men went to seek him and they told david wherefore he came down to the rock and abode in the wilderness of maon and when saul heard that he pursued after david in the wilderness of maon\\xa0 and saul went on this side of the mountain and david and his men on that side of the mountain and david made haste to get away for fear of saul for saul and his men compassed david and his men round about to take them\\xa0 but there came a messenger unto saul saying haste thee and come for the philistines have made a raid upon the land\\xa0 so saul returned from pursuing after david and went against the philistines therefore they called that place selahammahlekoth\\xa0 and david went up from thence and dwelt in the strongholds of engedi s\\xa0 and it came to pass when saul was returned from following the philistines that it was told him saying behold david is in the wilderness of engedi s\\xa0 then saul took three thousand chosen men out of all israel and went to seek david and his men upon the rocks of the wild goats\\xa0 and he came to the sheepcotes by the way where was a cave and saul went in to cover his feet now david and his men were sitting in the innermost parts of the cave\\xa0 and the men of david said unto him behold the day in which the lord hath said unto thee behold i will deliver thine enemy into thy hand and thou shalt do to him as it shall seem good unto thee then david arose and cut off the skirt of sauls robe privily\\xa0 and it came to pass afterward that davids heart smote him because he had cut off sauls skirt\\xa0 and he said unto his men the lord forbid it me that i should do this thing unto my lord the lords anointed to put forth my hand against him seeing he is the lords anointed\\xa0 so david checked his men with these words and suffered them not to rise against saul and saul rose up out of the cave and went on his way s\\xa0 david also arose afterward and went out of the cave and cried after saul saying my lord the king and when saul looked behind him david bowed with his face to the earth and prostrated himself s\\xa0 and david said to saul wherefore hearkenest thou to mens words saying behold david seeketh thy hurt\\xa0 behold this day thine eyes have seen how that the lord had delivered thee today into my hand in the cave and some bade me kill thee but mine eye spared thee and i said i will not put forth my hand against my lord for he is the lords anointed\\xa0 moreover my father see yea see the skirt of thy robe in my hand for in that i cut off the skirt of thy robe and killed thee not know thou and see that there is neither evil nor transgression in my hand and i have not sinned against thee though thou layest wait for my soul to take it\\xa0 the lord judge between me and thee and the lord avenge me of thee but my hand shall not be upon thee\\xa0 as saith the proverb of the ancients out of the wicked cometh forth wickedness but my hand shall not be upon thee\\xa0 after whom is the king of israel come out after whom dost thou pursue after a dead dog after a flea\\xa0 the lord therefore be judge and give sentence between me and thee and see and plead my cause and deliver me out of thy hand \\xa0 and it came to pass when david had made an end of speaking these words unto saul that saul said is this thy voice my son david and saul lifted up his voice and wept\\xa0 and he said to david thou art more righteous than i for thou hast rendered unto me good whereas i have rendered unto thee evil\\xa0 and thou hast declared this day how that thou hast dealt well with me forasmuch as when the lord had delivered me up into thy hand thou didst not kill me\\xa0 for if a man find his enemy will he let him go well away wherefore the lord reward thee good for that which thou hast done unto me this day\\xa0 and now behold i know that thou shalt surely be king and that the kingdom of israel shall be established in thy hand\\xa0 swear now therefore unto me by the lord that thou wilt not cut off my seed after me and that thou wilt not destroy my name out of my fathers house\\xa0 and david swore unto saul and saul went home but david and his men got them up unto the stronghold s\\xa0 and samuel died and all israel gathered themselves together and lamented him and buried him in his house at ramah and david arose and went down to the wilderness of paran \\xa0 and there was a man in maon whose possessions were in carmel and the man was very great and he had three thousand sheep and a thousand goats and he was shearing his sheep in carmel\\xa0 now the name of the man was nabal and the name of his wife abigail and the woman was of good understanding and of a beautiful form but the man was churlish and evil in his doings and he was of the house of caleb\\xa0 and david heard in the wilderness that nabal was shearing his sheep\\xa0 and david sent ten young men and david said unto the young men get you up to carmel and go to nabal and greet him in my name\\xa0 and thus ye shall say all hail and peace be both unto thee and peace be to thy house and peace be unto all that thou hast\\xa0 and now i have heard that thou hast shearers thy shepherds have now been with us and we did them no hurt neither was there aught missing unto them all the while they were in carmel\\xa0 ask thy young men and they will tell thee wherefore let the young men find favour in thine eyes for we come on a good day give i pray thee whatsoever cometh to thy hand unto thy servants and to thy son david\\xa0 and when davids young men came they spoke to nabal according to all those words in the name of david and ceased\\xa0 and nabal answered davids servants and said who is david and who is the son of jesse there are many servants nowadays that break away every man from his master\\xa0 shall i then take my bread and my water and my flesh that i have killed for my shearers and give it unto men of whom i know not whence they are\\xa0 so davids young men turned on their way and went back and came and told him according to all these words\\xa0 and david said unto his men gird ye on every man his sword and they girded on every man his sword and david also girded on his sword and there went up after david about four hundred men and two hundred abode by the baggage\\xa0 but one of the young men told abigail nabals wife saying behold david sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our master and he flew upon them\\xa0 but the men were very good unto us and we were not hurt neither missed we any thing as long as we went with them when we were in the fields\\xa0 they were a wall unto us both by night and by day all the while we were with them keeping the sheep\\xa0 now therefore know and consider what thou wilt do for evil is determined against our master and against all his house for he is such a base fellow that one cannot speak to him\\xa0 then abigail made haste and took two hundred loaves and two bottles of wine and five sheep ready dressed and five measures of parched corn and a hundred clusters of raisins and two hundred cakes of figs and laid them on asses\\xa0 and she said unto her young men go on before me behold i come after you but she told not her husband nabal\\xa0 and it was so as she rode on her ass and came down by the covert of the mountain that behold david and his men came down towards her and she met them\\xa0 now david had said surely in vain have i kept all that this fellow hath in the wilderness so that nothing was missed of all that pertained unto him and he hath returned me evil for good\\xa0 god do so unto the enemies of david and more also if i leave of all that pertain to him by the morning light so much as one male\\xa0 and when abigail saw david she made haste and alighted from her ass and fell before david on her face and bowed down to the ground\\xa0 and she fell at his feet and said upon me my lord upon me be the iniquity and let thy handmaid i pray thee speak in thine ears and hear thou the words of thy handmaid\\xa0 let not my lord i pray thee regard this base fellow even nabal for as his name is so is he nabal is his name and churlishness is with him but i thy handmaid saw not the young men of my lord whom thou didst send\\xa0 now therefore my lord as the lord liveth and as thy soul liveth seeing the lord hath withholden thee from bloodguiltines',\n",
       "  's and from finding redress for thyself with thine own hand now therefore let thine enemies and them that seek evil to my lord be as nabal\\xa0 and now this present which thy servant hath brought unto my lord let it be given unto the young men that follow my lord\\xa0 forgive i pray thee the trespass of thy handmaid for the lord will certainly make my lord a sure house because my lord fighteth the battles of the lord and evil is not found in thee all thy days\\xa0 and though man be risen up to pursue thee and to seek thy soul yet the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the lord thy god and the souls of thine enemies them shall he sling out as from the hollow of a sling\\xa0 and it shall come to pass when the lord shall have done to my lord according to all the good that he hath spoken concerning thee and shall have appointed thee prince over israel\\xa0 that this shall be no stumblingblock unto thee nor offence of heart unto my lord either that thou hast shed blood without cause or that my lord hath found redress for himself and when the lord shall have dealt well with my lord then remember thy handmaid s\\xa0 and david said to abigail blessed be the lord the god of israel who sent thee this day to meet me\\xa0 and blessed be thy discretion and blessed be thou that hast kept me this day from bloodguiltiness and from finding redress for myself with mine own hand\\xa0 for in very deed as the lord the god of israel liveth who hath withholden me from hurting thee except thou hadst made haste and come to meet me surely there had not been left unto nabal by the morning light so much as one male\\xa0 so david received of her hand that which she had brought him and he said unto her go up in peace to thy house see i have hearkened to thy voice and have accepted thy person\\xa0 and abigail came to nabal and behold he held a feast in his house like the feast of a king and nabals heart was merry within him for he was very drunken wherefore she told him nothing less or more until the morning light\\xa0 and it came to pass in the morning when the wine was gone out of nabal that his wife told him these things and his heart died within him and he became as a stone\\xa0 and it came to pass about ten days after that the lord smote nabal so that he died\\xa0 and when david heard that nabal was dead he said blessed be the lord that hath pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of nabal and hath kept back his servant from evil and the evildoing of nabal hath the lord returned upon his own head and david sent and spoke concerning abigail to take her to him to wife\\xa0 and when the servants of david were come to abigail to carmel they spoke unto her saying david hath sent us unto thee to take thee to him to wife\\xa0 and she arose and bowed down with her face to the earth and said behold thy handmaid is a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord\\xa0 and abigail hastened and arose and rode upon an ass with five damsels of hers that followed her and she went after the messengers of david and became his wife\\xa0 david also took ahinoam of jezreel and they became both of them his wives s\\xa0 now saul had given michal his daughter davids wife to palti the son of laish who was of gallim\\xa0 and the ziphites came unto saul to gibeah saying doth not david hide himself in the hill of hachilah which is before jeshimon\\xa0 then saul arose and went down to the wilderness of ziph having three thousand chosen men of israel with him to seek david in the wilderness of ziph\\xa0 and saul pitched in the hill of hachilah which is before jeshimon by the way but david abode in the wilderness and he saw that saul came after him into the wilderness\\xa0 david therefore sent out spies and understood that saul was come of a certainty\\xa0 and david arose and came to the place where saul had pitched and david beheld the place where saul lay and abner the son of ner the captain of his host and saul lay within the barricade and the people pitched round about him\\xa0 then answered david and said to ahimelech the hittite and to abishai the son of zeruiah brother to joab saying who will go down with me to saul to the camp and abishai said i will go down with thee\\xa0 so david and abishai came to the people by night and behold saul lay sleeping within the barricade with his spear stuck in the ground at his head and abner and the people lay round about him s\\xa0 then said abishai to david god hath delivered up thine enemy into thy hand this day now therefore let me smite him i pray thee with the spear to the earth at one stroke and i will not smite him the second time\\xa0 and david said to abishai destroy him not for who can put forth his hand against the lords anointed and be guiltless \\xa0 and david said as the lord liveth nay but the lord shall smite him or his day shall come to die or he shall go down into battle and be swept away\\xa0 the lord forbid it me that i should put forth my hand against the lords anointed but now take i pray thee the spear that is at his head and the cruse of water and let us go\\xa0 so david took the spear and the cruse of water from sauls head and they got them away and no man saw it nor knew it neither did any awake for they were all asleep because a deep sleep from the lord was fallen upon them\\xa0 then david went over to the other side and stood on the top of the mountain afar off a great space being between them\\xa0 and david cried to the people and to abner the son of ner saying answerest thou not abner then abner answered and said who art thou that criest to the king \\xa0 and david said to abner art not thou a valiant man and who is like to thee in israel wherefore then hast thou not kept watch over thy lord the king for there came one of the people in to destroy the king thy lord\\xa0 this thing is not good that thou hast done as the lord liveth ye deserve to die because ye have not kept watch over your lord the lords anointed and now see where the kings spear is and the cruse of water that was at his head\\xa0 and saul knew davids voice and said is this thy voice my son david and david said it is my voice my lord o king\\xa0 and he said wherefore doth my lord pursue after his servant for what have i done or what evil is in my hand\\xa0 now therefore i pray thee let my lord the king hear the words of his servant if it be the lord that hath stirred thee up against me let him accept an offering but if it be the children of men cursed be they before the lord for they have driven me out this day that i should not cleave unto the inheritance of the lord saying go serve other gods\\xa0 now therefore let not my blood fall to the earth away from the presence of the lord for the king of israel is come out to seek a single flea as when one doth hunt a partridge in the mountains\\xa0 then said saul i have sinned return my son david for i will no more do thee harm because my life was precious in thine eyes this day behold i have played the fool and erred exceedingly\\xa0 and david answered and said behold the kings spear let then one of the young men come over and fetch it\\xa0 and the lord will render to every man his righteousness and his faithfulness forasmuch as the lord delivered thee into my hand today and i would not put forth my hand against the lords anointed\\xa0 and behold as thy life was much set by this day in mine eyes so let my life be much set by in the eyes of the lord and let him deliver me out of all tribulation \\xa0 then saul said to david blessed be thou my son david thou shalt both do mightily and shalt surely prevail so david went his way and saul returned to his place \\xa0 and david said in his heart i shall now be swept away one day by the hand of saul there is nothing better for me than that i should escape into the land of the philistines and saul will despair of me to seek me any more in all the borders of israel so shall i escape out of his hand\\xa0 and david arose and passed over he and the six hundred men that were with him unto achish the son of maoch king of gath\\xa0 and david dwelt with achish at gath he and his men every man with his household even david with his two wives ahinoam the jezreelitess and abigail the carmelitess nabals wife\\xa0 and it was told saul that david was fled to gath and he sought no more again for him s\\xa0 and david said unto achish if now i have found favour in thine eyes let them give me a place in one of the cities in the country that i may dwell there for why should thy servant dwell in the royal city with thee\\xa0 then achish gave him ziklag that day wherefore ziklag belongeth unto the kings of judah unto this day \\xa0 and the number of the days that david dwelt in the country of the philistines was a full year and four months\\xa0 and david and his men went up and made a raid upon the geshurites and the gizrites and the amalekites for those were the inhabitants of the land who were of old as thou goest to shur even unto the land of egypt\\xa0 and david smote the land and left neither man nor woman alive and took away the sheep and the oxen and the asses and the camels and the apparel and he returned and came to achish\\xa0 and achish said whither have ye made a raid today and david said against the south of judah and against the south of the jerahmeelites and against the south of the kenites\\xa0 and david left neither man nor woman alive to bring them to gath saying lest they should tell on us saying so did david and so hath been his manner all the while he hath dwelt in the country of the philistines\\xa0 and achish believed david saying he hath made his people israel utterly to abhor him therefore he shall be my servant for ever \\xa0 and it came to pass in those days that the philistines gathered their hosts together for warfare to fight with israel and achish said unto david know thou assuredly that thou shalt go out with me in the host thou and thy men\\xa0 and david said to achish therefore thou shalt know what thy servant will do and achish said to david therefore will i make thee keeper of my head for ever \\xa0 now samuel was dead and all israel had lamented him and buried him in ramah even in his own city and saul had put away those that divined by a ghost or a familiar spirit out of the land\\xa0 and the philistines gathered themselves together and came and pitched in shunem and saul gathered all israel together and they pitched in gilboa\\xa0 and when saul saw the host of the philistines he was afraid and his heart trembled greatly\\xa0 and when saul inquired of the lord the lord answered him not neither by dreams nor by urim nor by prophets\\xa0 then said saul unto his servants seek me a woman that divineth by a ghost that i may go to her and inquire of her and his servants said to him behold there is a woman that divineth by a ghost at endor\\xa0 and saul disguised himself and put on other raiment and went he and two men with him and they came to the woman by night and he said divine unto me i pray thee by a ghost and bring me up whomsoever i shall name unto thee\\xa0 and the woman said unto him behold thou knowest what saul hath done how he hath cut off those that divine by a ghost or a familiar spirit out of the land wherefore then layest thou a snare for my life to cause me to die\\xa0 and saul swore to her by the lord saying as the lord liveth there shall no punishment happen to thee for this thing\\xa0 then said the woman whom shall i bring up unto thee and he said bring me up samuel\\xa0 and when the woman saw samuel she cried with a loud voice and the woman spoke to saul saying why hast thou deceived me for thou art saul\\xa0 and the king said unto her be not afraid for what seest thou and the woman said unto saul i see a godlike being coming up out of the earth\\xa0 and he said unto ',\n",
       "  'her what form is he of and she said an old man cometh up and he is covered with a robe and saul perceived that it was samuel and he bowed with his face to the ground and prostrated himself s\\xa0 and samuel said to saul why hast thou disquieted me to bring me up and saul answered i am sore distressed for the philistines make war against me and god is departed from me and answereth me no more neither by prophets nor by dreams therefore i have called thee that thou mayest make known unto me what i shall do s\\xa0 and samuel said wherefore then dost thou ask of me seeing the lord is departed from thee and is become thine adversary\\xa0 and the lord hath wrought for himself as he spoke by me and the lord hath rent the kingdom out of thy hand and given it to thy neighbour even to david\\xa0 because thou didst not hearken to the voice of the lord and didst not execute his fierce wrath upon amalek therefore hath the lord done this thing unto thee this day\\xa0 moreover the lord will deliver israel also with thee into the hand of the philistines and tomorrow shalt thou and thy sons be with me the lord will deliver the host of israel also into the hand of the philistines\\xa0 then saul fell straightway his full length upon the earth and was sore afraid because of the words of samuel and there was no strength in him for he had eaten no bread all the day nor all the night\\xa0 and the woman came unto saul and saw that he was sore affrighted and said unto him behold thy handmaid hath hearkened unto thy voice and i have put my life in my hand and have hearkened unto thy words which thou spokest unto me\\xa0 now therefore i pray thee hearken thou also unto the voice of thy handmaid and let me set a morsel of bread before thee and eat that thou mayest have strength when thou goest on thy way\\xa0 but he refused and said i will not eat but his servants together with the woman urged him and he hearkened unto their voice so he arose from the earth and sat upon the bed\\xa0 and the woman had a fatted calf in the house and she made haste and killed it and she took flour and kneaded it and did bake unleavened bread thereof\\xa0 and she brought it before saul and before his servants and they did eat then they rose up and went away that night \\xa0 now the philistines gathered together all their hosts to aphek and the israelites pitched by the fountain which is in jezreel\\xa0 and the lords of the philistines passed on by hundreds and by thousands and david and his men passed on in the rearward with achish\\xa0 then said the princes of the philistines what do these hebrews here and achish said unto the princes of the philistines is not this david the servant of saul the king of israel who hath been with me these days or these years and i have found no fault in him since he fell away unto me unto this day \\xa0 but the princes of the philistines were wroth with him and the princes of the philistines said unto him make the man return that he may go back to his place where thou hast appointed him and let him not go down with us to battle lest in the battle he become an adversary to us for wherewith should this fellow reconcile himself unto his lord should it not be with the heads of these men\\xa0 is not this david of whom they sang one to another in dances saying saul hath slain his thousands and david his ten thousands s\\xa0 then achish called david and said unto him as the lord liveth thou hast been upright and thy going out and thy coming in with me in the host is good in my sight for i have not found evil in thee since the day of thy coming unto me unto this day nevertheless the lords favour thee not\\xa0 wherefore now return and go in peace that thou displease not the lords of the philistines s\\xa0 and david said unto achish but what have i done and what hast thou found in thy servant so long as i have been before thee unto this day that i may not go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king\\xa0 and achish answered and said to david i know that thou art good in my sight as an angel of god notwithstanding the princes of the philistines have said he shall not go up with us to the battle\\xa0 wherefore now rise up early in the morning with the servants of thy lord that are come with thee and as soon as ye are up early in the morning and have light depart\\xa0 so david rose up early he and his men to depart in the morning to return into the land of the philistines and the philistines went up to jezreel s\\xa0 and it came to pass when david and his men were come to ziklag on the third day that the amalekites had made a raid upon the south and upon ziklag and had smitten ziklag and burned it with fire\\xa0 and had taken captive the women and all that were therein both small and great they slew not any but carried them off and went their way\\xa0 and when david and his men came to the city behold it was burned with fire and their wives and their sons and their daughters were taken captives\\xa0 then david and the people that were with him lifted up their voice and wept until they had no more power to weep\\xa0 and davids two wives were taken captives ahinoam the jezreelitess and abigail the wife of nabal the carmelite\\xa0 and david was greatly distressed for the people spoke of stoning him because the soul of all the people was grieved every man for his sons and for his daughters but david strengthened himself in the lord his god s\\xa0 and david said to abiathar the priest the son of ahimelech i pray thee bring me hither the ephod and abiathar brought thither the ephod to david\\xa0 and david inquired of the lord saying shall i pursue after this troop shall i overtake them and he answered him pursue for thou shalt surely overtake them and shalt without fail recover all\\xa0 so david went he and the six hundred men that were with him and came to the brook besor where those that were left behind stayed\\xa0 but david pursued he and four hundred men for two hundred stayed behind who were so faint that they could not go over the brook besor\\xa0 and they found an egyptian in the field and brought him to david and gave him bread and he did eat and they gave him water to drink\\xa0 and they gave him a piece of a cake of figs and two clusters of raisins and when he had eaten his spirit came back to him for he had eaten no bread nor drunk any water three days and three nights s\\xa0 and david said unto him to whom belongest thou and whence art thou and he said i am a young egyptian servant to an amalekite and my master left me because three days ago i fell sick\\xa0 we made a raid upon the south of the cherethites and upon that which belongeth to judah and upon the south of caleb and we burned ziklag with fire\\xa0 and david said to him wilt thou bring me down to this troop and he said swear unto me by god that thou wilt neither kill me nor deliver me up into the hands of my master and i will bring thee down to this troop\\xa0 and when he had brought him down behold they were spread abroad over all the ground eating and drinking and feasting because of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the land of the philistines and out of the land of judah\\xa0 and david smote them from the twilight even unto the evening of the next day and there escaped not a man of them save four hundred young men who rode upon camels and fled\\xa0 and david recovered all that the amalekites had taken and david rescued his two wives\\xa0 and there was nothing lacking to them neither small nor great neither sons nor daughters neither spoil nor any thing that they had taken to them david brought back all\\xa0 and david took all the flocks and the herds which they drove before those other cattle and said this is davids spoil\\xa0 and david came to the two hundred men who were so faint that they could not follow david whom also they had made to abide at the brook besor and they went forth to meet david and to meet the people that were with him and when david came near to the people he saluted them s\\xa0 then answered all the wicked men and base fellows of those that went with david and said because they went not with us we will not give them aught of the spoil that we have recovered save to every man his wife and his children that they may lead them away and depart s\\xa0 then said david ye shall not do so my brethren with that which the lord hath given unto us who hath preserved us and delivered the troop that came against us into our hand\\xa0 and who will hearken unto you in this matter for as is the share of him that goeth down to the battle so shall be the share of him that tarrieth by the baggage they shall share alike s\\xa0 and it was so from that day forward that he made it a statute and an ordinance for israel unto this day \\xa0 and when david came to ziklag he sent of the spoil unto the elders of judah even to his friends saying behold a present for you of the spoil of the enemies of the lord\\xa0 to them that were in bethel and to them that were in ramoth of the south and to them that were in jattir\\xa0 and to them that were in aroer and to them that were in siphmoth and to them that were in eshtemoa\\xa0 and to them that were in racal and to them that were in the cities of the jerahmeelites and to them that were in the cities of the kenites\\xa0 and to them that were in hormah and to them that were in borashan and to them that were in athach\\xa0 and to them that were in hebron and to all the places where david himself and his men were wont to haunt \\xa0 now the philistines fought against israel and the men of israel fled from before the philistines and fell down slain in mount gilboa\\xa0 and the philistines followed hard upon saul and upon his sons and the philistines slew jonathan and abinadab and malchishua the sons of saul\\xa0 and the battle went sore against saul and the archers overtook him and he was in great anguish by reason of the archers\\xa0 then said saul to his armourbearer draw thy sword and thrust me through therewith lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through and make a mock of me but his armourbearer would not for he was sore afraid therefore saul took his sword and fell upon it\\xa0 and when his armourbearer saw that saul was dead he likewise fell upon his sword and died with him\\xa0 so saul died and his three sons and his armourbearer and all his men that same day together\\xa0 and when the men of israel that were on the other side of the valley and they that were beyond the jordan saw that the men of israel fled and that saul and his sons were dead they forsook the cities and fled and the philistines came and dwelt in them \\xa0 and it came to pass on the morrow when the philistines came to strip the slain that they found saul and his three sons fallen in mount gilboa\\xa0 and they cut off his head and stripped off his armour and sent into the land of the philistines round about to carry the tidings unto the house of their idols and to the people\\xa0 and they put his armour in the house of the ashtaroth and they fastened his body to the wall of bethshan\\xa0 and when the inhabitants of jabeshgilead heard concerning him that which the philistines had done to saul\\xa0 all the valiant men arose and went all night and took the body of saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of bethshan and they came to jabesh and burnt them there\\xa0 and they took their bones and buried them under the tamarisktree in jabesh and fasted seven days \\xa0 and it came to pass after the death of saul when david was returned from the slaughter of the amalekites and david had abode two days in ziklag\\xa0 it came even to pass on the third day that behold a man came out of the camp from saul with his clothes rent and earth upon his head and so it was when he came to david that he fell to the earth and prostrate',\n",
       "  'd himself\\xa0 and david said unto him from whence comest thou and he said unto him out of the camp of israel am i escaped\\xa0 and david said unto him how went the matter i pray thee tell me and he answered the people are fled from the battle and many of the people also are fallen and dead and saul and jonathan his son are dead also\\xa0 and david said unto the young man that told him how knowest thou that saul and jonathan his son are dead\\xa0 and the young man that told him said as i happened by chance upon mount gilboa behold saul leaned upon his spear and lo the chariots and the horsemen pressed hard upon him\\xa0 and when he looked behind him he saw me and called unto me and i answered here am i\\xa0 and he said unto me who art thou and i answered him i am an amalekite\\xa0 and he said unto me stand i pray thee beside me and slay me for the agony hath taken hold of me because my life is just yet in me\\xa0 so i stood beside him and slew him because i was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen and i took the crown that was upon his head and the bracelet that was on his arm and have brought them hither unto my lord\\xa0 then david took hold on his clothes and rent them and likewise all the men that were with him\\xa0 and they wailed and wept and fasted until even for saul and for jonathan his son and for the people of the lord and for the house of israel because they were fallen by the sword \\xa0 and david said unto the young man that told him whence art thou and he answered i am the son of an amalekite stranger\\xa0 and david said unto him how wast thou not afraid to put forth thy hand to destroy the lords anointed\\xa0 and david called one of the young men and said go near and fall upon him and he smote him that he died\\xa0 and david said unto him thy blood be upon thy head for thy mouth hath testified against thee saying i have slain the lords anointed \\xa0 and david lamented with this lamentation over saul and over jonathan his son\\xa0 and saidto teach the sons of judah the bow behold it is written in the book of jashar\\xa0 thy beauty o israel upon thy high places is slain how are the mighty fallen\\xa0 tell it not in gath publish it not in the streets of ashkelon lest the daughters of the philistines rejoice lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph\\xa0 ye mountains of gilboa let there be no dew nor rain upon you neither fields of choice fruits for there the shield of the mighty was vilely cast away the shield of saul not anointed with oil\\xa0 from the blood of the slain from the fat of the mighty the bow of jonathan turned not back and the sword of saul returned not empty\\xa0 saul and jonathan the lovely and the pleasant in their lives even in their death they were not divided they were swifter than eagles they were stronger than lions\\xa0 ye daughters of israel weep over saul who clothed you in scarlet with other delights who put ornaments of gold upon your apparel\\xa0 how are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle jonathan upon thy high places is slain\\xa0 i am distressed for thee my brother jonathan very pleasant hast thou been unto me wonderful was thy love to me passing the love of women\\xa0 how are the mighty fallen and the weapons of war perished \\xa0 and it came to pass after this that david inquired of the lord saying shall i go up into any of the cities of judah and the lord said unto him go up and david said whither shall i go up and he said unto hebron\\xa0 so david went up thither and his two wives also ahinoam the jezreelitess and abigail the wife of nabal the carmelite\\xa0 and his men that were with him did david bring up every man with his household and they dwelt in the cities of hebron\\xa0 and the men of judah came and they there anointed david king over the house of judah and they told david saying the men of jabeshgilead were they that buried saul s\\xa0 and david sent messengers unto the men of jabeshgilead and said unto them blessed be ye of the lord that ye have shown this kindness unto your lord even unto saul and have buried him\\xa0 and now the lord show kindness and truth unto you and i also will requite you this kindness because ye have done this thing\\xa0 now therefore let your hands be strong and be ye valiant for saul your lord is dead and also the house of judah have anointed me king over them \\xa0 now abner the son of ner captain of sauls host had taken ishbosheth the son of saul and brought him over to mahanaim\\xa0 and he made him king over gilead and over the ashurites and over jezreel and over ephraim and over benjamin and over all israel \\xa0 ishbosheth sauls son was forty years old when he began to reign over israel and he reigned two years but the house of judah followed david\\xa0 and the time that david was king in hebron over the house of judah was seven years and six months s\\xa0 and abner the son of ner and the servants of ishbosheth the son of saul went out from mahanaim to gibeon\\xa0 and joab the son of zeruiah and the servants of david went out and they met together by the pool of gibeon and sat down the one on the one side of the pool and the other on the other side of the pool\\xa0 and abner said to joab let the young men i pray thee arise and play before us and joab said let them arise\\xa0 then they arose and passed over by number twelve for benjamin and for ishbosheth the son of saul and twelve of the servants of david\\xa0 and they caught every one his fellow by the head and thrust his sword in his fellows side so they fell down together wherefore that place was called helkathhazzurim which is in gibeon\\xa0 and the battle was very sore that day and abner was beaten and the men of israel before the servants of david\\xa0 and the three sons of zeruiah were there joab and abishai and asahel and asahel was as light of foot as one of the roes that are in the field\\xa0 and asahel pursued after abner and in going he turned not to the right hand nor to the left from following abner\\xa0 then abner looked behind him and said is it thou asahel and he answered it is i\\xa0 and abner said to him turn thee aside to thy right hand or to thy left and lay thee hold on one of the young men and take thee his armour but asahel would not turn aside from following him\\xa0 and abner said again to asahel turn thee aside from following me wherefore should i smite thee to the ground how then should i hold up my face to joab thy brother\\xa0 howbeit he refused to turn aside wherefore abner with the hinder end of the spear smote him in the groin that the spear came out behind him and he fell down there and died in the same place and it came to pass that as many as came to the place where asahel fell down and died stood still\\xa0 but joab and abishai pursued after abner and the sun went down when they were come to the hill of ammah that lieth before giah by the way of the wilderness of gibeon\\xa0 and the children of benjamin gathered themselves together after abner and became one band and stood on the top of a hill\\xa0 then abner called to joab and said shall the sword devour for ever knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the end how long shall it be then ere thou bid the people return from following their brethren\\xa0 and joab said as god liveth if thou hadst not spoken surely then only after the morning the people had gone away every one from following his brother\\xa0 so joab blew the horn and all the people stood still and pursued after israel no more neither fought they any more\\xa0 and abner and his men went all that night through the arabah and they passed over the jordan and went through all bithron and came to mahanaim\\xa0 and joab returned from following abner and when he had gathered all the people together there lacked of davids servants nineteen men and asahel\\xa0 but the servants of david had smitten of benjamin even of abners menthree hundred and threescore men died\\xa0 and they took up asahel and buried him in the sepulchre of his father which was in bethlehem and joab and his men went all night and the day broke upon them at hebron\\xa0 now there was long war between the house of saul and the house of david and david waxed stronger and stronger but the house of saul waxed weaker and weaker s\\xa0 and unto david were sons born in hebron and his firstborn was amnon of ahinoam the jezreelitess\\xa0 and his second chileab of abigail the wife of nabal the carmelite and the third absalom the son of maacah the daughter of talmai king of geshur\\xa0 and the fourth adonijah the son of haggith and the fifth shephatiah the son of abital\\xa0 and the sixth ithream of eglah davids wife these were born to david in hebron \\xa0 and it came to pass while there was war between the house of saul and the house of david that abner showed himself strong in the house of saul\\xa0 now saul had a concubine whose name was rizpah the daughter of aiah and  said to abner wherefore hast thou gone in unto my fathers concubine\\xa0 then was abner very wroth for the words of ishbosheth and said am i a dogs head that belongeth to judah this day do i show kindness unto the house of saul thy father to his brethren and to his friends and have not delivered thee into the hand of david and yet thou chargest me this day with a fault concerning this woman s\\xa0 god do so to abner and more also if as the lord hath sworn to david i do not even so to him\\xa0 to transfer the kingdom from the house of saul and to set up the throne of david over israel and over judah from dan even to beersheba\\xa0 and he could not answer abner another word because he feared him s\\xa0 and abner sent messengers to david straightway saying whose is the land saying also make thy league with me and behold my hand shall be with thee to bring over all israel unto thee\\xa0 and he said well i will make a league with thee but one thing i require of thee that is thou shalt not see my face except thou first bring michal sauls daughter when thou comest to see my face s\\xa0 and david sent messengers to ishbosheth sauls son saying deliver me my wife michal whom i betrothed to me for a hundred foreskins of the philistines\\xa0 and ishbosheth sent and took her from her husband even from paltiel the son of laish\\xa0 and her husband went with her weeping as he went and followed her to bahurim then said abner unto him go return and he returned\\xa0 and abner had communication with the elders of israel saying in times past ye sought for david to be king over you\\xa0 now then do it for the lord hath spoken of david saying by the hand of my servant david i will save my people israel out of the hand of the philistines and out of the hand of all their enemies\\xa0 and abner also spoke in the ears of benjamin and abner went also to speak in the ears of david in hebron all that seemed good to israel and to the whole house of benjamin\\xa0 so abner came to david to hebron and twenty men with him and david made abner and the men that were with him a feast\\xa0 and abner said unto david i will arise and go and will gather all israel unto my lord the king that they may make a covenant with thee and that thou mayest reign over all that thy soul desireth and david sent abner away and he went in peace\\xa0 and behold the servants of david and joab came from a foray and brought in a great spoil with them but abner was not with david in hebron for he had sent him away and he was gone in peace\\xa0 when joab and all the host that was with him were come they told joab saying abner the son of ner came to the king and he hath sent him away and he is gone in peace\\xa0 then joab came to the king and said what hast thou done behold abner came unto thee why is it that thou hast sent him away and he is quite gone\\xa0 thou knowest abner the son of ner that he came to deceive thee and to know thy going out and thy coming in and to k',\n",
       "  'now all that thou doest\\xa0 and when joab was come out from david he sent messengers after abner and they brought him back from borsirah but david knew it not\\xa0 and when abner was returned to hebron joab took him aside into the midst of the gate to speak with him quietly and smote him there in the groin that he died for the blood of asahel his brother\\xa0 and afterward when david heard it he said i and my kingdom are guiltless before the lord for ever from the blood of abner the son of ner\\xa0 let it fall upon the head of joab and upon all his fathers house and let there not fail from the house of joab one that hath an issue or that is a leper or that leaneth on a staff or that falleth by the sword or that lacketh bread\\xa0 so joab and abishai his brother slew abner because he had killed their brother asahel at gibeon in the battle s\\xa0 and david said to joab and to all the people that were with him rend your clothes and gird you with sackcloth and wail before abner and king david followed the bier\\xa0 and they buried abner in hebron and the king lifted up his voice and wept at the grave of abner and all the people wept s\\xa0 and the king lamented for abner and said should abner die as a churl dieth\\xa0 thy hands were not bound nor thy feet put into fetters as a man falleth before the children of iniquity so didst thou fall and all the people wept again over him\\xa0 and all the people came to cause david to eat bread while it was yet day but david swore saying god do so to me and more also if i taste bread or aught else till the sun be down\\xa0 and all the people took notice of it and it pleased them whatsoever the king did pleased all the people\\xa0 so all the people and all israel understood that day that it was not of the king to slay abner the son of ner s\\xa0 and the king said unto his servants know ye not that there is a prince and a great man fallen this day in israel\\xa0 and i am this day weak and just anointed king and these men the sons of zeruiah are too hard for me the lord reward the evildoer according to his wickedness \\xa0 and when sauls son heard that abner was dead in hebron his hands became feeble and all the israelites were affrighted\\xa0 and sauls son had two men that were captains of bands the name of the one was baanah and the name of the other rechab the sons of rimmon the beerothite of the children of benjamin for beeroth also is reckoned to benjamin\\xa0 and the beerothites fled to gittaim and have been sojourners there until this day s\\xa0 now jonathan sauls son had a son that was lame of his feet he was five years old when the tidings came of saul and jonathan out of jezreel and his nurse took him up and fled and it came to pass as she made haste to flee that he fell and became lame and his name was mephibosheth\\xa0 and the sons of rimmon the beerothite rechab and baanah went and came about the heat of the day to the house of ishbosheth as he took his rest at noon\\xa0 and they came thither into the midst of the house as though they would have fetched wheat and they smote him in the groin and rechab and baanah his brother escaped\\xa0 now when they came into the house as he lay on his bed in his bedchamber they smote him and slew him and beheaded him and took his head and went by the way of the arabah all night\\xa0 and they brought the head of ishbosheth unto david to hebron and said to the king behold the head of ishbosheth the son of saul thine enemy who sought thy life and the lord hath avenged my lord the king this day of saul and of his seed\\xa0 and david answered rechab and baanah his brother the sons of rimmon the beerothite and said unto them as the lord liveth who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity\\xa0 when one told me saying behold saul is dead and he was in his own eyes as though he brought good tidings i took hold of him and slew him in ziklag instead of giving a reward for his tidings\\xa0 how much more when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house upon his bed shall i not now require his blood of your hand and take you away from the earth\\xa0 and david commanded his young men and they slew them and cut off their hands and their feet and hanged them up beside the pool in hebron but they took the head of ishbosheth and buried it in the grave of abner in hebron \\xa0 then came all the tribes of israel to david unto hebron and spoke saying behold we are thy bone and thy flesh\\xa0 in times past when saul was king over us it was thou that didst lead out and bring in israel and the lord said to thee thou shalt feed my people israel and thou shalt be prince over israel\\xa0 so all the elders of israel came to the king to hebron and king david made a covenant with them in hebron before the lord and they anointed david king over israel s\\xa0 david was thirty years old when he began to reign and he reigned forty years\\xa0 in hebron he reigned over judah seven years and six months and in jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all israel and judah\\xa0 and the king and his men went to jerusalem against the jebusites the inhabitants of the land who spoke unto david saying except thou take away the blind and the lame thou shalt not come in hither thinking david cannot come in hither\\xa0 nevertheless david took the stronghold of zion the same is the city of david\\xa0 and david said on that day whosoever smiteth the jebusites and getteth up to the gutter and  the lame and the blind that are hated of davids soul wherefore they say there are the blind and the lame he cannot come into the house\\xa0 and david dwelt in the stronghold and called it the city of david and david built round about from millo and inward\\xa0 and david waxed greater and greater for the lord the god of hosts was with him \\xa0 and hiram king of tyre sent messengers to david and cedartrees and carpenters and masons and they built david a house\\xa0 and david perceived that the lord had established him king over israel and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people israels sake s\\xa0 and david took him more concubines and wives out of jerusalem after he was come from hebron and there were yet sons and daughters born to david\\xa0 and these are the names of those that were born unto him in jerusalem shammua and shobab and nathan and solomon\\xa0 and ibhar and elishua and nepheg and japhia\\xa0 and elishama and eliada and eliphelet \\xa0 and when the philistines heard that david was anointed king over israel all the philistines went up to seek david and david heard of it and went down to the hold\\xa0 now the philistines had come and spread themselves in the valley of rephaim\\xa0 and david inquired of the lord saying shall i go up against the philistines wilt thou deliver them into my hand p\\xa0and the lord said unto david go up for i will certainly deliver the philistines into thy hand\\xa0 and david came to baalperazim and david smote them there and he said the lord hath broken mine enemies before me like the breach of waters therefore the name of that place was called baalperazim\\xa0 and they left their images there and david and his men took them away \\xa0 and the philistines came up yet again and spread themselves in the valley of rephaim\\xa0 and when david inquired of the lord he said thou shalt not go up make a circuit behind them and come upon them over against the mulberrytrees\\xa0 and it shall be when thou hearest the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberrytrees that then thou shalt bestir thyself for then is the lord gone out before thee to smite the host of the philistines\\xa0 and david did so as the lord commanded him and smote the philistines from geba until thou come to gezer \\xa0 and david again gathered together all the chosen men of israel thirty thousand\\xa0 and david arose and went with all the people that were with him from baalejudah to bring up from thence the ark of god whereupon is called the name even the name of the lord of hosts that sitteth upon the cherubim\\xa0 and they set the ark of god upon a new cart and brought it out of the house of abinadab that was in the hill and uzzah and ahio the sons of abinadab drove the new cart\\xa0 and they brought it out of the house of abinadab which was in the hill with the ark of god and ahio went before the ark\\xa0 and david and all the house of israel played before the lord with all manner of instruments made of cypresswood and with harps and with psalteries and with timbrels and with sistra and with cymbals\\xa0 and when they came to the threshingfloor of nacon uzzah put forth his hand to the ark of god and took hold of it for the oxen stumbled\\xa0 and the anger of the lord was kindled against uzzah and god smote him there for his error and there he died by the ark of god\\xa0 and david was displeased because the lord had broken forth upon uzzah and that place was called perezuzzah unto this day\\xa0 and david was afraid of the lord that day and he said how shall the ark of the lord come unto me\\xa0 so david would not remove the ark of the lord unto him into the city of david but david carried it aside into the house of obededom the gittite\\xa0 and the ark of the lord remained in the house of obededom the gittite three months and the lord blessed obededom and all his house\\xa0 and it was told king david saying the lord hath blessed the house of obededom and all that pertaineth unto him because of the ark of god and david went and brought up the ark of god from the house of obededom into the city of david with joy\\xa0 and it was so that when they that bore the ark of the lord had gone six paces he sacrificed an ox and a fatling\\xa0 and david danced before the lord with all his might and david was girded with a linen ephod\\xa0 so david and all the house of israel brought up the ark of the lord with shouting and with the sound of the horn\\xa0 and it was so as the ark of the lord came into the city of david that michal the daughter of saul looked out at the window and saw king david leaping and dancing before the lord and she despised him in her heart\\xa0 and they brought in the ark of the lord and set it in its place in the midst of the tent that david had pitched for it and david offered burntofferings and peaceofferings before the lord\\xa0 and when david had made an end of offering the burntoffering and the peaceofferings he blessed the people in the name of the lord of hosts\\xa0 and he dealt among all the people even among the whole multitude of israel both to men and women to every one a cake of bread and a cake made in a pan and a sweet cake so all the people departed every one to his house\\xa0 then david returned to bless his household s and michal the daughter of saul came out to meet david and said how did the king of israel get him honour today who uncovered himself today in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovereth himself\\xa0 and david said unto michal before the lord who chose me above thy father and above all his house to appoint me prince over the people of the lord over israel before the lord will i make merry\\xa0 and i will be yet more vile than thus and will be base in mine own sight and with the handmaids whom thou hast spoken of with them will i get me honour\\xa0 and michal the daughter of saul had no child unto the day of her death \\xa0 and it came to pass when the king dwelt in his house and the lord had given him rest from all his enemies round about\\xa0 that the king said unto nathan the prophet see now i dwell in a house of cedar but the ark of god dwelleth within curtains\\xa0 and nathan said to the king go do all that is in thy heart for the lord is with thee\\xa0 and it came to pass the same night s that the word of the lord came unto nathan saying\\xa0 go and tell my servant david s thus saith the lord shalt ',\n",
       "  'thou build me a house for me to dwell in\\xa0 for i have not dwelt in a house since the day that i brought up the children of israel out of egypt even to this day but have walked in a tent and in a tabernacle\\xa0 in all places wherein i have walked among all the children of israel spoke i a word with any of the tribes of israel whom i commanded to feed my people israel saying why have ye not built me a house of cedar\\xa0 now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant david thus saith the lord of hosts i took thee from the sheepcote from following the sheep that thou shouldest be prince over my people over israel\\xa0 and i have been with thee whithersoever thou didst go and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee and i will make thee a great name like unto the name of the great ones that are in the earth\\xa0 and i will appoint a place for my people israel and will plant them that they may dwell in their own place and be disquieted no more neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more as at the first\\xa0 even from the day that i commanded judges to be over my people israel and i will cause thee to rest from all thine enemies moreover the lord telleth thee that the lord will make thee a house\\xa0 when thy days are fulfilled and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers i will set up thy seed after thee that shall proceed out of thy body and i will establish his kingdom\\xa0 he shall build a house for my name and i will establish the throne of his kingdom for ever\\xa0 i will be to him for a father and he shall be to me for a son if he commit iniquity i will chasten him with the rod of men and with the stripes of the children of men\\xa0 but my mercy shall not depart from him as i took it from saul whom i put away before thee\\xa0 and thy house and thy kingdom shall be made sure for ever before thee thy throne shall be established for ever\\xa0 according to all these words and according to all this vision so did nathan speak unto david \\xa0 then david the king went in and sat before the lord and he said who am i o lord god and what is my house that thou hast brought me thus far\\xa0 and this was yet a small thing in thine eyes o lord god but thou hast spoken also of thy servants house for a great while to come and this too after the manner of great men o lord god\\xa0 and what can david say more unto thee for thou knowest thy servant o lord god\\xa0 for thy words sake and according to thine own heart hast thou wrought all this greatness to make thy servant know it\\xa0 therefore thou art great o lord god for there is none like thee neither is there any god beside thee according to all that we have heard with our ears\\xa0 and who is like thy people like israel a nation one in the earth whom god went to redeem unto himself for a people and to make him a name and to do for thy land great things and tremendous even for you  from before thy people whom thou didst redeem to thee out of egypt the nations and their gods\\xa0 and thou didst establish to thyself thy people israel to be a people unto thee for ever and thou lord becamest their god s\\xa0 and now o lord god the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant and concerning his house confirm thou it for ever and do as thou hast spoken\\xa0 and let thy name be magnified for ever that it may be said the lord of hosts is god over israel and the house of thy servant david shall be established before thee\\xa0 for thou o lord of hosts the god of israel hast revealed to thy servant saying i will build thee a house therefore hath thy servant taken heart to pray this prayer unto thee\\xa0 and now o lord god thou alone art god and thy words are truth and thou hast promised this good thing unto thy servant\\xa0 now therefore let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant that it may continue for ever before thee for thou o lord god hast spoken it and through thy blessing let the house of thy servant be blessed for ever \\xa0 and after this it came to pass that david smote the philistines and subdued them and david took methegammah out of the hand of the philistines\\xa0 and he smote moab and measured them with the line making them to lie down on the ground and he measured two lines to put to death and one full line to keep alive and the moabites became servants to david and brought presents\\xa0 david smote also hadadezer the son of rehob king of zobah as he went to establish his dominion at the river euphrates\\xa0 and david took from him a thousand and seven hundred horsemen and twenty thousand footmen and david houghed all the chariot horses but reserved of them for a hundred chariots\\xa0 and when the arameans of damascus came to succour hadadezer king of zobah david smote of the arameans two and twenty thousand men\\xa0 then david put garrisons in aram of damascus and the arameans became servants to david and brought presents and the lord gave victory to david whithersoever he went\\xa0 and david took the shields of gold that were on the servants of hadadezer and brought them to jerusalem\\xa0 and from betah and from berothai cities of hadadezer king david took exceeding much brass s\\xa0 and when toi king of hamath heard that david had smitten all the host of hadadezer\\xa0 then toi sent joram his son unto king david to salute him and to bless himbecause he had fought against hadadezer and smitten him for hadadezer had wars with toiand he brought with him vessels of silver and vessels of gold and vessels of brass\\xa0 these also did king david dedicate unto the lord with the silver and gold that he dedicated of all the nations which he subdued\\xa0 of aram and of moab and of the children of ammon and of the philistines and of amalek and of the spoil of hadadezer son of rehob king of zobah\\xa0 and david got him a name when he returned from smiting the arameans in the valley of salt even eighteen thousand men\\xa0 and he put garrisons in edom throughout all edom put he garrisons and all the edomites became servants to david and the lord gave victory to david whithersoever he went\\xa0 and david reigned over all israel and david executed justice and righteousness unto all his people\\xa0 and joab the son of zeruiah was over the host and jehoshaphat the son of ahilud was recorder\\xa0 and zadok the son of ahitub and ahimelech the son of abiathar were priests and seraiah was scribe\\xa0 and benaiah the son of jehoiada was over the cherethites and the pelethites and davids sons were chief ministers s\\xa0 and david said is there yet any that is left of the house of saul that i may show him kindness for jonathans sake\\xa0 now there was of the house of saul a servant whose name was ziba and they called him unto david and the king said unto him art thou ziba and he said thy servant is he\\xa0 and the king said is there not yet any of the house of saul that i may show the kindness of god unto him and ziba said unto the king jonathan hath yet a son who is lame on his feet\\xa0 and the king said unto him where is he and ziba said unto the king behold he is in the house of machir the son of ammiel in lodebar\\xa0 then king david sent and fetched him out of the house of machir the son of ammiel from lodebar\\xa0 and mephibosheth the son of jonathan the son of saul came unto david and fell on his face and prostrated himself and david said mephibosheth and he answered behold thy servant\\xa0 and david said unto him fear not for i will surely show thee kindness for jonathan thy fathers sake and will restore thee all the land of saul thy father and thou shalt eat bread at my table continually\\xa0 and he bowed down and said what is thy servant that thou shouldest look upon such a dead dog as i am\\xa0 then the king called to ziba sauls servant and said unto him all that pertained to saul and to all his house have i given unto thy masters son\\xa0 and thou shalt till the land for him thou and thy sons and thy servants and thou shalt bring in the fruits that thy masters son may have bread to eat but mephibosheth thy masters son shall eat bread continually at my table now ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants\\xa0 then said ziba unto the king according to all that my lord the king commandeth his servant so shall thy servant do but mephibosheth eateth at my table as one of the kings sons\\xa0 now mephibosheth had a young son whose name was mica and all that dwelt in the house of ziba were servants unto mephibosheth\\xa0 but mephibosheth dwelt in jerusalem for he did eat continually at the kings table and he was lame on both his feet \\xa0 and it came to pass after this that the king of the children of ammon died and hanun his son reigned in his stead\\xa0 and david said i will show kindness unto hanun the son of nahash as his father showed kindness unto me so david sent by the hand of his servants to comfort him concerning his father and davids servants came into the land of the children of ammon\\xa0 but the princes of the children of ammon said unto hanun their lord thinkest thou that david doth honour thy father that he hath sent comforters unto thee hath not david sent his servants unto thee to search the city and to spy it out and to overthrow it\\xa0 so hanun took davids servants and shaved off the one half of their beards and cut off their garments in the middle even to their buttocks and sent them away\\xa0 when they told it unto david he sent to meet them for the men were greatly ashamed and the king said tarry at jericho until your beards be grown and then return\\xa0 and when the children of ammon saw that they were become odious to david the children of ammon sent and hired the arameans of bethrehob and the arameans of zobah twenty thousand footmen and the king of maacah with a thousand men and the men of tob twelve thousand men\\xa0 and when david heard of it he sent joab and all the host of the mighty men\\xa0 and the children of ammon came out and put the battle in array at the entrance of the gate and the arameans of zobah and of rehob and the men of tob and maacah were by themselves in the field\\xa0 now when joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind he chose of all the choice men of israel and put them in array against the arameans\\xa0 and the rest of the people he committed into the hand of abishai his brother and he put them in array against the children of ammon\\xa0 and he said if the arameans be too strong for me then thou shalt help me but if the children of ammon be too strong for thee then i will come and help thee\\xa0 be of good courage and let us prove strong for our people and for the cities of our god and the lord do that which seemeth him good\\xa0 so joab and the people that were with him drew nigh unto the battle against the arameans and they fled before him\\xa0 and when the children of ammon saw that the arameans were fled they likewise fled before abishai and entered into the city then joab returned from the children of ammon and came to jerusalem\\xa0 and when the arameans saw that they were put to the worse before israel they gathered themselves together\\xa0 and hadadezer sent and brought out the arameans that were beyond the river and they came to helam with shobach the captain of the host of hadadezer at their head s\\xa0 and it was told david and he gathered all israel together and passed over the jordan and came to helam and the arameans set themselves in array against david and fought with him\\xa0 and the arameans fled before israel and david slew of the arameans seven hundred drivers of chariots and forty thousand horsemen and smote shobach the captain of their host so that he died there\\xa0 and when all the kings that were servants to hadadezer saw that they were put to the worse before israel they made peace with israel and served them so the arameans feared to help the children of amm',\n",
       "  'on any more \\xa0 and it came to pass at the return of the year at the time when kings go out to battle that david sent joab and his servants with him and all israel and they destroyed the children of ammon and besieged rabbah but david tarried at jerusalem s\\xa0 and it came to pass at eventide that david arose from off his bed and walked upon the roof of the kings house and from the roof he saw a woman bathing and the woman was very beautiful to look upon\\xa0 and david sent and inquired after the woman and one said is not this bathsheba the daughter of eliam the wife of uriah the hittite\\xa0 and david sent messengers and took her and she came in unto him and he lay with her for she was purified from her uncleanness and she returned unto her house\\xa0 and the woman conceived and she sent and told david and said i am with child\\xa0 and david sent to joab send me uriah the hittite and joab sent uriah to david\\xa0 and when uriah was come unto him david asked of him how joab did and how the people fared and how the war prospered\\xa0 and david said to uriah go down to thy house and wash thy feet and uriah departed out of the kings house and there followed him a mess of food from the king\\xa0 but uriah slept at the door of the kings house with all the servants of his lord and went not down to his house\\xa0 and when they had told david saying uriah went not down unto his house david said unto uriah art thou not come from a journey wherefore didst thou not go down unto thy house\\xa0 and uriah said unto david the ark and israel and judah abide in booths and my lord joab and the servants of my lord are encamped in the open field shall i then go into my house to eat and to drink and to lie with my wife as thou livest and as thy soul liveth i will not do this thing\\xa0 and david said to uriah tarry here today also and tomorrow i will let thee depart so uriah abode in jerusalem that day and the morrow\\xa0 and when david had called him he did eat and drink before him and he made him drunk and at even he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord but went not down to his house\\xa0 and it came to pass in the morning that david wrote a letter to joab and sent it by the hand of uriah\\xa0 and he wrote in the letter saying set ye uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle and retire ye from him that he may be smitten and die s\\xa0 and it came to pass when joab kept watch upon the city that he assigned uriah unto the place where he knew that valiant men were\\xa0 and the men of the city went out and fought with joab and there fell some of the people even of the servants of david and uriah the hittite died also\\xa0 then joab sent and told david all the things concerning the war\\xa0 and he charged the messenger saying when thou hast made an end of telling all the things concerning the war unto the king\\xa0 it shall be that if the kings wrath arise and he say unto thee wherefore went ye so nigh unto the city to fight knew ye not that they would shoot from the wall\\xa0 who smote abimelech the son of jerubbesheth did not a woman cast an upper millstone upon him from the wall that he died at thebez why went ye so nigh the wall then shalt thou say thy servant uriah the hittite is dead also\\xa0 so the messenger went and came and told david all that joab had sent him for\\xa0 and the messenger said unto david the men prevailed against us and came out unto us into the field and we were upon them even unto the entrance of the gate\\xa0 and the shooters shot at thy servants from off the wall and some of the kings servants are dead and thy servant uriah the hittite is dead also s\\xa0 then david said unto the messenger thus shalt thou say unto joab let not this thing displease thee for the sword devoureth in one manner or another make thy battle more strong against the city and overthrow it and encourage thou him\\xa0 and when the wife of uriah heard that uriah her husband was dead she made lamentation for her husband\\xa0 and when the mourning was past david sent and took her home to his house and she became his wife and bore him a son but the thing that david had done displeased the lord \\xa0 and the lord sent nathan unto david and he came unto him and said unto him there were two men in one city the one rich and the other poor\\xa0 the rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds\\xa0 but the poor man had nothing save one little ewe lamb which he had bought and reared and it grew up together with him and with his children it did eat of his own morsel and drank of his own cup and lay in his bosom and was unto him as a daughter\\xa0 and there came a traveller unto the rich man and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd to dress for the wayfaring man that was come unto him but took the poor mans lamb and dressed it for the man that was come to him\\xa0 and davids anger was greatly kindled against the man and he said to nathan as the lord liveth the man that hath done this deserveth to die\\xa0 and he shall restore the lamb fourfold because he did this thing and because he had no pity s\\xa0 and nathan said to david thou art the man s thus saith the lord the god of israel i anointed thee king over israel and i delivered thee out of the hand of saul\\xa0 and i gave thee thy masters house and thy masters wives into thy bosom and gave thee the house of israel and of judah and if that were too little then would i add unto thee so much more\\xa0 wherefore hast thou despised the word of the lord to do that which is evil in my sight uriah the hittite thou hast smitten with the sword and his wife thou hast taken to be thy wife and him thou hast slain with the sword of the children of ammon\\xa0 now therefore the sword shall never depart from thy house because thou hast despised me and hast taken the wife of uriah the hittite to be thy wife s\\xa0 thus saith the lord behold i will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house and i will take thy wives before thine eyes and give them unto thy neighbour and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this sun\\xa0 for thou didst it secretly but i will do this thing before all israel and before the sun s\\xa0 and david said unto nathan i have sinned against the lord s and nathan said unto david the lord also hath put away thy sin thou shalt not die\\xa0 howbeit because by this deed thou hast greatly blasphemed the enemies of the lord the child also that is born unto thee shall surely die\\xa0 and nathan departed unto his house and the lord struck the child that uriahs wife bore unto david and it was very sick\\xa0 david therefore besought god for the child and david fasted and as often as he went in he lay all night upon the earth\\xa0 and the elders of his house arose and stood beside him to raise him up from the earth but he would not neither did he eat bread with them\\xa0 and it came to pass on the seventh day that the child died and the servants of david feared to tell him that the child was dead for they said behold while the child was yet alive we spoke unto him and he hearkened not unto our voice how then shall we tell him that the child is dead so that he do himself some harm\\xa0 but when david saw that his servants whispered together david perceived that the child was dead and david said unto his servants is the child dead and they said he is dead\\xa0 then david arose from the earth and washed and anointed himself and changed his apparel and he came into the house of the lord and worshipped then he came to his own house and when he required they set bread before him and he did eat\\xa0 then said his servants unto him what thing is this that thou hast done thou didst fast and weep for the child while it was alive but when the child was dead thou didst rise and eat bread\\xa0 and he said while the child was yet alive i fasted and wept for i said who knoweth whether the lord will not be gracious to me that the child may live\\xa0 but now he is dead wherefore should i fast can i bring him back again i shall go to him but he will not return to me\\xa0 and david comforted bathsheba his wife and went in unto her and lay with her and she bore a son and called his name solomon and the lord loved him\\xa0 and he sent by the hand of nathan the prophet and he called his name jedidiah for the lords sake \\xa0 now joab fought against rabbah of the children of ammon and took the royal city\\xa0 and joab sent messengers to david and said i have fought against rabbah yea i have taken the city of waters\\xa0 now therefore gather the rest of the people together and encamp against the city and take it lest i take the city and it be called after my name\\xa0 and david gathered all the people together and went to rabbah and fought against it and took it\\xa0 and he took the crown of malcam from off his head and the weight thereof was a talent of gold and in it were precious stones and it was set on davids head and he brought forth the spoil of the city exceeding much\\xa0 and he brought forth the people that were therein and put them under saws and under harrows of iron and under axes of iron and made them pass through the brickkiln and thus did he unto all the cities of the children of ammon and david and all the people returned unto jerusalem \\xa0 and it came to pass after this that absalom the son of david had a fair sister whose name was tamar and amnon the son of david loved her\\xa0 and amnon was so distressed that he fell sick because of his sister tamar for she was a virgin and it seemed hard to amnon to do any thing unto her\\xa0 but amnon had a friend whose name was jonadab the son of shimeah davids brother and jonadab was a very subtle man\\xa0 and he said unto him why o son of the king art thou thus becoming leaner from day to day wilt thou not tell me and amnon said unto him i love tamar my brother absaloms sister\\xa0 and jonadab said unto him lay thee down on thy bed and feign thyself sick and when thy father cometh to see thee say unto him let my sister tamar come i pray thee and give me bread to eat and dress the food in my sight that i may see it and eat it at her hand\\xa0 so amnon lay down and feigned himself sick and when the king was come to see him amnon said unto the king let my sister tamar come i pray thee and make me a couple of cakes in my sight that i may eat at her hand\\xa0 then david sent home to tamar saying go now to thy brother amnons house and dress him food\\xa0 so tamar went to her brother amnons house and he was lying down and she took dough and kneaded it and made cakes in his sight and did bake the cakes\\xa0 and she took the pan and poured them out before him but he refused to eat and amnon said have out all men from me and they went out every man from him\\xa0 and amnon said unto tamar bring the food into the chamber that i may eat of thy hand and tamar took the cakes which she had made and brought them into the chamber to amnon her brother\\xa0 and when she had brought them near unto him to eat he took hold of her and said unto her come lie with me my sister\\xa0 and she answered him nay my brother do not force me for no such thing ought to be done in israel do not thou this wanton deed\\xa0 and i whither shall i carry my shame and as for thee thou wilt be as one of the base men in israel now therefore i pray thee speak unto the king for he will not withhold me from thee\\xa0 howbeit he would not hearken unto her voice but being stronger than she he forced her and lay with her\\xa0 then amnon hated her with exceeding great hatred for the hatred wherewith he hated her was greater than the love wherewith he had loved her and amnon said unto her arise be gone\\xa0 and she said unto him not so because this great wrong in putting me forth is worse than the other that thou didst unto me but he would not hearken unto her\\xa0 then he cal',\n",
       "  'led his servant that ministered unto him and said put now this woman out from me and bolt the door after her\\xa0 now she had a garment of many colours upon her for with such robes were the kings daughters that were virgins apparelledand his servant brought her out and bolted the door after her\\xa0 and tamar put ashes on her head and rent her garment of many colours that was on her and she laid her hand on her head and went her way crying aloud as she went\\xa0 and absalom her brother said unto her hath amnon thy brother been with thee but now hold thy peace my sister he is thy brother take not this thing to heart so tamar remained desolate in her brother absaloms house\\xa0 but when king david heard of all these things he was very wroth\\xa0 and absalom spoke unto amnon neither good nor bad for absalom hated amnon because he had forced his sister tamar \\xa0 and it came to pass after two full years that absalom had sheepshearers in baalhazor which is beside ephraim and absalom invited all the kings sons\\xa0 and absalom came to the king and said behold now thy servant hath sheepshearers let the king i pray thee and his servants go with thy servant\\xa0 and the king said to absalom nay my son let us not all go lest we be burdensome unto thee and he pressed him howbeit he would not go but blessed him\\xa0 then said absalom if not i pray thee let my brother amnon go with us and the king said unto him why should he go with thee\\xa0 but absalom pressed him and he let amnon and all the kings sons go with him s\\xa0 and absalom commanded his servants saying mark ye now when amnons heart is merry with wine and when i say unto you smite amnon then kill him fear not have not i commanded you be courageous and be valiant\\xa0 and the servants of absalom did unto amnon as absalom had commanded then all the kings sons arose and every man got him up upon his mule and fled\\xa0 and it came to pass while they were in the way that the tidings came to david saying absalom hath slain all the kings sons and there is not one of them left \\xa0 then the king arose and rent his garments and lay on the earth and all his servants stood by with their clothes rent s\\xa0 and jonadab the son of shimeah davids brother answered and said let not my lord suppose that they have killed all the young men the kings sons for amnon only is dead for by the appointment of absalom this hath been determined from the day that he forced his sister tamar\\xa0 now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his heart to think that all the kings sons are dead for amnon only is dead \\xa0 but absalom fled and the young man that kept the watch lifted up his eyes and looked and behold there came much people in a roundabout way by the hillside\\xa0 and jonadab said unto the king behold the kings sons are come as thy servant said so it is\\xa0 and it came to pass as soon as he had made an end of speaking that behold the kings sons came and lifted up their voice and wept and the king also and all his servants wept very sore\\xa0 but absalom fled and went to talmai the son of ammihud king of geshur and  mourned for his son every day\\xa0 so absalom fled and went to geshur and was there three years\\xa0 and the soul of king david failed with longing for absalom for he was comforted concerning amnon seeing he was dead s\\xa0 now joab the son of zeruiah perceived that the kings heart was toward absalom\\xa0 and joab sent to tekoa and fetched thence a wise woman and said unto her i pray thee feign thyself to be a mourner and put on mourning apparel i pray thee and anoint not thyself with oil but be as a woman that had a long time mourned for the dead\\xa0 and go in to the king and speak on this manner unto him so joab put the words in her mouth\\xa0 and when the woman of tekoa spoke to the king she fell on her face to the ground and prostrated herself and said help o king s\\xa0 and the king said unto her what aileth thee and she answered of a truth i am a widow my husband being dead\\xa0 and thy handmaid had two sons and they two strove together in the field and there was none to part them but the one smote the other and killed him\\xa0 and behold the whole family is risen against thy handmaid and they said deliver him that smote his brother that we may kill him for the life of his brother whom he slew and so destroy the heir also thus will they quench my coal which is left and will leave to my husband neither name nor remainder upon the face of the earth \\xa0 and the king said unto the woman go to thy house and i will give charge concerning thee\\xa0 and the woman of tekoa said unto the king my lord o king the iniquity be on me and on my fathers house and the king and his throne be guiltless s\\xa0 and the king said whosoever saith aught unto thee bring him to me and he shall not touch thee any more\\xa0 then said she i pray thee let the king remember the lord thy god that the avenger of blood destroy not any more lest they destroy my son and he said as the lord liveth there shall not one hair of thy son fall to the earth\\xa0 then the woman said let thy handmaid i pray thee speak a word unto my lord the king and he said say on s\\xa0 and the woman said wherefore then hast thou devised such a thing against the people of god for in speaking this word the king is as one that is guilty in that the king doth not fetch home again his banished one\\xa0 for we must needs die and are as water spilt on the ground which cannot be gathered up again neither doth god respect any person but let him devise means that he that is banished be not an outcast from him\\xa0 now therefore seeing that i am come to speak this word unto my lord the king it is because the people have made me afraid and thy handmaid said i will now speak unto the king it may be that the king will perform the request of his servant\\xa0 for the king will hear to deliver his servant out of the hand of the man that would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of god\\xa0 then thy handmaid said let i pray thee the word of my lord the king be for my comfort for as an angel of god so is my lord the king to discern good and bad and the lord thy god be with thee \\xa0 then the king answered and said unto the woman hide not from me i pray thee aught that i shall ask thee and the woman said let my lord the king now speak\\xa0 and the king said is the hand of joab with thee in all this and the woman answered and said as thy soul liveth my lord the king none can turn to the right hand or to the left from aught that my lord the king hath spoken for thy servant joab he bade me and he put all these words in the mouth of thy handmaid\\xa0 to change the face of the matter hath thy servant joab done this thing and my lord is wise according to the wisdom of an angel of god to know all things that are in the earth s\\xa0 and the king said unto joab behold now i have granted this request go therefore bring the young man absalom back\\xa0 and joab fell to the ground on his face and prostrated himself and blessed the king and joab said today thy servant knoweth that i have found favour in thy sight my lord o king in that the king hath performed the request of thy servant\\xa0 so joab arose and went to geshur and brought absalom to jerusalem s\\xa0 and the king said let him turn to his own house but let him not see my face so absalom turned to his own house and saw not the kings face s\\xa0 now in all israel there was none to be so much praised as absalom for his beauty from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him\\xa0 and when he polled his headnow it was at every years end that he polled it because the hair was heavy on him therefore he polled ithe weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels after the kings weight\\xa0 and unto absalom there were born three sons and one daughter whose name was tamar she was a woman of a fair countenance \\xa0 and absalom dwelt two full years in jerusalem and he saw not the kings face\\xa0 then absalom sent for joab to send him to the king but he would not come to him and he sent again a second time but he would not come\\xa0 therefore he said unto his servants see joabs field is near mine and he hath barley there go and set it on fire and absaloms servants set the field on fire \\xa0 then joab arose and came to absalom unto his house and said unto him wherefore have thy servants set my field on fire\\xa0 and absalom answered joab behold i sent unto thee saying come hither that i may send thee to the king to say wherefore am i come from geshur it were better for me to be there still now therefore let me see the kings face and if there be iniquity in me let him kill me\\xa0 so joab came to the king and told him and when he had called for absalom he came to the king and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king and the king kissed absalom s\\xa0 and it came to pass after this that absalom prepared him a chariot and horses and fifty men to run before him\\xa0 and absalom used to rise up early and stand beside the way of the gate and it was so that when any man had a suit which should come to the king for judgment then absalom called unto him and said of what city art thou and he said thy servant is of one of the tribes of israel\\xa0 and absalom said unto him see thy matters are good and right but there is no man deputed of the king to hear thee\\xa0 absalom said moreover oh that i were made judge in the land that every man who hath any suit or cause might come unto me and i would do him justice\\xa0 and it was so that when any man came nigh to prostrate himself before him he put forth his hand and took hold of him and kissed him\\xa0 and on this manner did absalom to all israel that came to the king for judgment so absalom stole the hearts of the men of israel \\xa0 and it came to pass at the end of forty years that absalom said unto the king i pray thee let me go and pay my vow which i have vowed unto the lord in hebron\\xa0 for thy servant vowed a vow while i abode at geshur in aram saying if the lord shall indeed bring me back to jerusalem then i will serve the lord\\xa0 and the king said unto him go in peace so he arose and went to hebron \\xa0 but absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of israel saying as soon as ye hear the sound of the horn then ye shall say absalom is king in hebron\\xa0 and with absalom went two hundred men out of jerusalem that were invited and went in their simplicity and they knew not any thing\\xa0 and absalom sent for ahithophel the gilonite davids counsellor from his city even from giloh while he offered the sacrifices and the conspiracy was strong for the people increased continually with absalom\\xa0 and there came a messenger to david saying the hearts of the men of israel are after absalom\\xa0 and david said unto all his servants that were with him at jerusalem arise and let us flee for else none of us shall escape from absalom make speed to depart lest he overtake us quickly and bring down evil upon us and smite the city with the edge of the sword\\xa0 and the kings servants said unto the king behold thy servants are ready to do whatsoever my lord the king shall choose\\xa0 and the king went forth and all his household after him and the king left ten women that were concubines to keep the house\\xa0 and the king went forth and all the people after him and they tarried in bethmerhak\\xa0 and all his servants passed on beside him and all the cherethites and all the pelethites and all the gittites six hundred men that came after him from gath passed on before the king s\\xa0 then said the king to ittai the gittite wherefore goest thou also with us return and abide with the king for thou art a foreigner and also an exile from thine own place\\xa0 whereas thou camest but yesterday should i',\n",
       "  ' this day make thee go up and down with us seeing i go whither i may return thou and take back thy brethren with thee in kindness and truth\\xa0 and ittai answered the king and said as the lord liveth and as my lord the king liveth surely in what place my lord the king shall be whether for death or for life even there also will thy servant be\\xa0 and david said to ittai go and pass over and ittai the gittite passed over and all his men and all the little ones that were with him\\xa0 and all the country wept with a loud voice as all the people passed over and as the king passed over the brook kidron all the people passed over toward the way of the wilderness\\xa0 and lo zadok also came and all the levites with him bearing the ark of the covenant of god and they set down the ark of godbut abiathar went upuntil all the people had done passing out of the city s\\xa0 and the king said unto zadok carry back the ark of god into the city if i shall find favour in the eyes of the lord he will bring me back and show me both it and his habitation\\xa0 but if he say thus i have no delight in thee behold here am i let him do to me as seemeth good unto him s\\xa0 the king said also unto zadok the priest seest thou return into the city in peace and your two sons with you ahimaaz thy son and jonathan the son of abiathar\\xa0 see i will tarry in the plains of the wilderness until there come word from you to announce unto me\\xa0 zadok therefore and abiathar carried the ark of god back to jerusalem and they abode there\\xa0 and david went up by the ascent of the mount of olives and wept as he went up and he had his head covered and went barefoot and all the people that were with him covered every man his head and they went up weeping as they went up\\xa0 and one told david saying ahithophel is among the conspirators with absalom and david said o lord i pray thee turn the counsel of ahithophel into foolishness\\xa0 and it came to pass that when david was come to the top of the ascent where god was wont to be worshipped behold hushai the archite came to meet him with his coat rent and earth upon his head\\xa0 and david said unto him if thou passest on with me then thou wilt be a burden unto me\\xa0 but if thou return to the city and say unto absalom i will be thy servant o king as i have been thy fathers servant in time past so will i now be thy servant then wilt thou defeat for me the counsel of ahithophel\\xa0 and hast thou not there with thee zadok and abiathar the priests therefore it shall be that what thing soever thou shalt hear out of the kings house thou shalt tell it to zadok and abiathar the priests\\xa0 behold they have there with them their two sons ahimaaz zadoks son and jonathan abiathars son and by them ye shall send unto me every thing that ye shall hear\\xa0 so hushai davids friend came into the city and absalom was at the point of coming into jerusalem s\\xa0 and when david was a little past the top behold ziba the servant of mephibosheth met him with a couple of asses saddled and upon them two hundred loaves of bread and a hundred clusters of raisins and a hundred of summer fruits and a bottle of wine\\xa0 and the king said unto ziba what meanest thou by these and ziba said the asses are for the kings household to ride on and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat and the wine that such as are faint in the wilderness may drink\\xa0 and the king said and where is thy masters son and ziba said unto the king behold he abideth at jerusalem for he said today will the house of israel restore me the kingdom of my father\\xa0 then said the king to ziba behold thine is all that pertaineth unto mephibosheth and ziba said i prostrate myself let me find favour in thy sight my lord o king\\xa0 and when king david came to bahurim behold there came out thence a man of the family of the house of saul whose name was shimei the son of gera he came out and kept on cursing as he came\\xa0 and he cast stones at david and at all the servants of king david and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left\\xa0 and thus said shimei when he cursed begone begone thou man of blood and base fellow\\xa0 the lord hath returned upon thee all the blood of the house of saul in whose stead thou hast reigned and the lord hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of absalom thy son and behold thou art taken in thine own mischief because thou art a man of blood\\xa0 then said abishai the son of zeruiah unto the king why should this dead dog curse my lord the king let me go over i pray thee and take off his head s\\xa0 and the king said what have i to do with you ye sons of zeruiah so let him curse because the lord hath said unto him curse david who then shall say wherefore hast thou done so s\\xa0 and david said to abishai and to all his servants behold my son who came forth of my body seeketh my life how much more this benjamite now let him alone and let him curse for the lord hath bidden him\\xa0 it may be that the lord will look on mine eye and that the lord will requite me good for his cursing of me this day\\xa0 so david and his men went by the way s and shimei went along on the hillside over against him and cursed as he went and threw stones at him and cast dust \\xa0 and the king and all the people that were with him came weary and he refreshed himself there\\xa0 and absalom and all the people the men of israel came to jerusalem and ahithophel with him\\xa0 and it came to pass when hushai the archite davids friend was come unto absalom that hushai said unto absalom long live the king long live the king\\xa0 and absalom said to hushai is this thy kindness to thy friend why wentest thou not with thy friend\\xa0 and hushai said unto absalom nay but whom the lord and this people and all the men of israel have chosen his will i be and with him will i abide\\xa0 and again whom should i serve should i not serve in the presence of his son as i have served in thy fathers presence so will i be in thy presence \\xa0 then said absalom to ahithophel give your counsel what we shall do\\xa0 and ahithophel said unto absalom go in unto thy fathers concubines that he hath left to keep the house and all israel will hear that thou art abhorred of thy father then will the hands of all that are with thee be strong\\xa0 so they spread absalom a tent upon the top of the house and absalom went in unto his fathers concubines in the sight of all israel\\xa0 now the counsel of ahithophel which he counselled in those days was as if a man inquired of the word of god so was all the counsel of ahithophel both with david and with absalom s\\xa0 moreover ahithophel said unto absalom let me now choose out twelve thousand men and i will arise and pursue after david this night\\xa0 and i will come upon him while he is weary and weakhanded and will make him afraid and all the people that are with him shall flee and i will smite the king only\\xa0 and i will bring back all the people unto thee when all shall have returned  the man whom thou seekest all the people will be in peace\\xa0 and the saying pleased absalom well and all the elders of israel s\\xa0 then said absalom call now hushai the archite also and let us hear likewise what he saith\\xa0 and when hushai was come to absalom absalom spoke unto him saying ahithophel hath spoken after this manner shall we do after his saying if not speak thou s\\xa0 and hushai said unto absalom the counsel that ahithophel hath given this time is not good\\xa0 hushai said moreover thou knowest thy father and his men that they are mighty men and they are embittered in their minds as a bear robbed of her whelps in the field and thy father is a man of war and will not lodge with the people\\xa0 behold he is hid now in some pit or in some place and it will come to pass when they fall upon them at the first and whosoever heareth it shall say there is a slaughter among the people that follow absalom\\xa0 then even he that is valiant whose heart is as the heart of a lion will utterly melt for all israel knoweth that thy father is a mighty man and they that are with him are valiant men\\xa0 but i counsel that all israel be gathered together unto thee from dan even to beersheba as the sand that is by the sea for multitude and that thou go to battle in thine own person\\xa0 so shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found and we will light upon him as the dew falleth on the ground and of him and of all the men that are with him we will not leave so much as one\\xa0 moreover if he withdraw himself into a city then shall all israel bring up ropes to that city and we will draw it into the valley until there be not one small stone found there \\xa0 and absalom and all the men of israel said the counsel of hushai the archite is better than the counsel of ahithophel s for the lord had ordained to defeat the good counsel of ahithophel to the intent that the lord might bring evil upon absalom s\\xa0 then said hushai unto zadok and to abiathar the priests thus and thus did ahithophel counsel absalom and the elders of israel and thus and thus have i counselled\\xa0 now therefore send quickly and tell david saying lodge not this night in the plains of the wilderness but in any wise pass over lest the king be swallowed up and all the people that are with him\\xa0 now jonathan and ahimaaz stayed by enrogel and a maidservant used to go and tell them and they went and told king david for they might not be seen to come into the city\\xa0 but a lad saw them and told absalom and they went both of them away quickly and came to the house of a man in bahurim who had a well in his court and they went down thither\\xa0 and the woman took and spread the covering over the wells mouth and strewed groats thereon and nothing was known\\xa0 and absaloms servants came to the woman to the house and they said where are ahimaaz and jonathan and the woman said unto them they are gone over the brook of water and when they had sought and could not find them they returned to jerusalem s\\xa0 and it came to pass after they were departed that they came up out of the well and went and told king david and they said unto david arise ye and pass quickly over the water for thus hath ahithophel counselled against you\\xa0 then david arose and all the people that were with him and they passed over the jordan by the morning light there lacked not one of them that was not gone over the jordan\\xa0 and when ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed he saddled his ass and arose and got him home unto his city and set his house in order and strangled himself and he died and was buried in the sepulchre of his father s\\xa0 when david was come to mahanaim absalom passed over the jordan he and all the men of israel with him\\xa0 and absalom had set amasa over the host instead of joab now amasa was the son of a man whose name was ithra the jesraelite that went in to abigal the daughter of nahash sister to zeruiah joabs mother\\xa0 and israel and absalom pitched in the land of gilead s\\xa0 and it came to pass when david was come to mahanaim that shobi the son of nahash of rabbah of the children of ammon and machir the son of ammiel of lodebar and barzillai the gileadite of rogelim\\xa0 brought beds and basins and earthen vessels and wheat and barley and meal and parched corn and beans and lentils and parched pulse\\xa0 and honey and curd and sheep and cheese of kine for david and for the people that were with him to eat for they said the people is hungry and faint and thirsty in the wilderness s\\xa0 and david numbered the people that were with him and set captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them\\xa0 and david sent forth the people a third part under the hand of joab and a third part under the hand of abishai the son of ',\n",
       "  'zeruiah joabs brother and a third part under the hand of ittai the gittite s and the king said unto the people i will surely go forth with you myself also\\xa0 but the people said thou shalt not go forth for if we flee away they will not care for us neither if half of us die will they care for us but thou art worth ten thousand of us therefore now it is better that thou be ready to succour us out of the city s\\xa0 and the king said unto them what seemeth you best i will do and the king stood by the gateside and all the people went out by hundreds and by thousands\\xa0 and the king commanded joab and abishai and ittai saying deal gently for my sake with the young man even with absalom and all the people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning absalom\\xa0 so the people went out into the field against israel and the battle was in the forest of ephraim\\xa0 and the people of israel were smitten there before the servants of david and there was a great slaughter there that day of twenty thousand men\\xa0 for the battle was there spread over the face of all the country and the forest devoured more people that day than the sword devoured\\xa0 and absalom chanced to meet the servants of david and absalom was riding upon his mule and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great terebinth and his head caught hold of the terebinth and he was taken up between the heaven and the earth and the mule that was under him went on\\xa0 and a certain man saw it and told joab and said behold i saw absalom hanging in a terebinth\\xa0 and joab said unto the man that told him and behold thou sawest it and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground and i would have had to give thee ten pieces of silver and a girdle\\xa0 and the man said unto joab though i should receive a thousand pieces of silver in my hand yet would i not put forth my hand against the kings son for in our hearing the king charged thee and abishai and ittai saying beware that none touch the young man absalom\\xa0 otherwise if i had dealt falsely against mine own lifeand there is no matter hid from the kingthen thou thyself wouldest have stood aloof\\xa0 then said joab i may not tarry thus with thee and he took three darts in his hand and thrust them through the heart of absalom while he was yet alive in the midst of the terebinth\\xa0 and ten young men that bore joabs armour compassed about and smote absalom and slew him\\xa0 and joab blew the horn and the people returned from pursuing after israel for joab held back the people\\xa0 and they took absalom and cast him into the great pit in the forest and raised over him a very great heap of stones and all israel fled every one to his tent\\xa0 now absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself the pillar which is in the kings dale for he said i have no son to keep my name in remembrance and he called the pillar after his own name and it is called absaloms monument unto this day s\\xa0 then said ahimaaz the son of zadok let me now run and bear the king tidings how that the lord hath avenged him of his enemies\\xa0 and joab said unto him thou shalt not be the bearer of tidings this day but thou shalt bear tidings another day but this day thou shalt bear no tidings forasmuch as the kings son is dead\\xa0 then said joab to the cushite go tell the king what thou hast seen and the cushite bowed down unto joab and ran\\xa0 then said ahimaaz the son of zadok yet again to joab but come what may let me i pray thee also run after the cushite and joab said wherefore wilt thou run my son seeing that thou wilt have no reward for the tidings\\xa0 but come what may  i will run and he said unto him run then ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain and overran the cushite\\xa0 now david sat between the two gates and the watchman went up to the roof of the gate unto the wall and lifted up his eyes and looked and behold a man running alone\\xa0 and the watchman cried and told the king and the king said if he be alone there is tidings in his mouth and he came apace and drew near\\xa0 and the watchman saw another man running and the watchman called unto the porter and said behold another man running alone and the king said he also bringeth tidings\\xa0 and the watchman said i think the running of the foremost is like the running of ahimaaz the son of zadok and the king said he is a good man and cometh with good tidings\\xa0 and ahimaaz called and said unto the king all is well and he bowed down before the king with his face to the earth s and said blessed be the lord thy god who hath delivered up the men that lifted up their hand against my lord the king s\\xa0 and the king said is it well with the young man absalom and ahimaaz answered when joab sent the kings servant and me thy servant i saw a great tumult but i knew not what it was\\xa0 and the king said turn aside and stand here and he turned aside and stood still\\xa0 and behold the cushite came and the cushite said tidings for my lord the king for the lord hath avenged thee this day of all them that rose up against thee s\\xa0 and the king said unto the cushite is it well with the young man absalom and the cushite answered the enemies of my lord the king and all that rise up against thee to do thee hurt be as that young man is s\\xa0 and the king was much moved and went up to the chamber over the gate and wept and as he went thus he said o my son absalom my son my son absalom would i had died for thee o absalom my son my son\\xa0 and it was told joab behold the king weepeth and mourneth for absalom\\xa0 and the victory that day was turned into mourning unto all the people for the people heard say that day the king grieveth for his son\\xa0 and the people got them by stealth that day into the city as people that are ashamed steal away when they flee in battle\\xa0 and the king covered his face and the king cried with a loud voice o my son absalom o absalom my son my son s\\xa0 and joab came into the house to the king and said thou hast shamed this day the faces of all thy servants who this day have saved thy life and the lives of thy sons and of thy daughters and the lives of thy wives and the lives of thy concubines\\xa0 in that thou lovest them that hate thee and hatest them that love thee for thou hast declared this day that princes and servants are nought unto thee for this day i perceive that if absalom had lived and all we had died this day then it had pleased thee well\\xa0 now therefore arise go forth and speak to the heart of thy servants s for i swear by the lord if thou go not forth there will not tarry a man with thee this night and that will be worse unto thee than all the evil that hath befallen thee from thy youth until now s\\xa0 then the king arose and sat in the gate and they told unto all the people saying behold the king doth sit in the gate and all the people came before the king now israel had fled every man to his tent s\\xa0 and all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of israel saying the king delivered us out of the hand of our enemies and he saved us out of the hand of the philistines and now he is fled out of the land from absalom\\xa0 and absalom whom we anointed over us is dead in battle now therefore why speak ye not a word of bringing the king back s\\xa0 and king david sent to zadok and to abiathar the priests saying speak unto the elders of judah saying why are ye the last to bring the king back to his housefor the speech of all israel was come to the king to bring him to his house\\xa0 ye are my brethren ye are my bone and my flesh wherefore then should ye be the last to bring back the king\\xa0 and say ye to amasa art thou not my bone and my flesh god do so to me and more also if thou be not captain of the host before me continually in the room of joab\\xa0 and he bowed the heart of all the men of judah even as the heart of one man so that they sent unto the king return thou and all thy servants\\xa0 so the king returned and came to the jordan and judah came to gilgal to go to meet the king to bring the king over the jordan\\xa0 and shimei the son of gera the benjamite who was of bahurim made haste and came down with the men of judah to meet king david\\xa0 and there were a thousand men of benjamin with him and ziba the servant of the house of saul and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him and they rushed into the jordan before the king\\xa0 and the ferryboat passed to and fro to bring over the kings household and to do what he thought good and shimei the son of gera fell down before the king when he would go over the jordan\\xa0 and he said unto the king let not my lord impute iniquity unto me neither do thou remember that which thy servant did iniquitously the day that my lord the king went out of jerusalem that the king should take it to his heart\\xa0 for thy servant doth know that i have sinned therefore behold i am come this day the first of all the house of joseph to go down to meet my lord the king s\\xa0 but abishai the son of zeruiah answered and said shall not shimei be put to death for this because he cursed the lords anointed s\\xa0 and david said what have i to do with you ye sons of zeruiah that ye should this day be adversaries unto me shall there any man be put to death this day in israel for do not i know that i am this day king over israel\\xa0 and the king said unto shimei thou shalt not die and the king swore unto him s\\xa0 and mephibosheth the son of saul came down to meet the king and he had neither dressed his feet nor trimmed his beard nor washed his clothes from the day the king departed until the day he came home in peace\\xa0 and it came to pass when he was come to jerusalem to meet the king that the king said unto him wherefore wentest not thou with me mephibosheth\\xa0 and he answered my lord o king my servant deceived me for thy servant said i will saddle me an ass that i may ride thereon and go with the king because thy servant is lame\\xa0 and he hath slandered thy servant unto my lord the king but my lord the king is as an angel of god do therefore what is good in thine eyes\\xa0 for all my fathers house were deserving of death at the hand of my lord the king yet didst thou set thy servant among them that did eat at thine own table what right therefore have i yet or why should i cry any more unto the king \\xa0 and the king said unto him why speakest thou any more of thy matters i say thou and ziba divide the land\\xa0 and mephibosheth said unto the king yea let him take all forasmuch as my lord the king is come in peace unto his own house s\\xa0 and barzillai the gileadite came down from rogelim and he passed on to jordan with the king to bring him on the way over the jordan\\xa0 now barzillai was a very aged man even fourscore years old and he had provided the king with sustenance while he lay at mahanaim for he was a very great man\\xa0 and the king said unto barzillai come thou over with me and i will sustain thee with me in jerusalem\\xa0 and barzillai said unto the king how many are the days of the years of my life that i should go up with the king unto jerusalem\\xa0 i am this day fourscore years old can i discern between good and bad can thy servant taste what i eat or what i drink can i hear any more the voice of singing men and singing women wherefore then should thy servant be yet a burden unto my lord the king\\xa0 thy servant would but just go over the jordan with the king and why should the king recompense it me with such a reward\\xa0 let thy servant i pray thee turn back that i may die in mine own city by the grave of my father and my mother but behold thy servant chimham let him go over with my lord the king and do to him what shall seem good unto thee s\\xa0 and the king answered chimham shall go over with me and i will do to',\n",
       "  ' him that which shall seem good unto thee and whatsoever thou shalt require of me that will i do for thee\\xa0 and all the people went over the jordan and the king went over and the king kissed barzillai and blessed him and he returned unto his own place s\\xa0 so the king went over to gilgal and chimham went over with him and all the people of judah brought the king over and also half the people of israel\\xa0 and behold all the men of israel came to the king and said unto the king why have our brethren the men of judah stolen thee away and brought the king and his household over the jordan and all davids men with him s\\xa0 and all the men of judah answered the men of israel because the king is near of kin to us wherefore then are ye angry for this matter have we eaten at all of the kings cost or hath any gift been given us s\\xa0 and the men of israel answered the men of judah and said we have ten parts in the king and we have also more right in david than ye why then did ye despise us that our advice should not be first had in bringing back our king and the words of the men of judah were fiercer than the words of the men of israel s\\xa0 now there happened to be there a base fellow whose name was sheba the son of bichri a benjamite and he blew the horn and said we have no portion in david neither have we inheritance in the son of jesse every man to his tents o israel\\xa0 so all the men of israel went up from following david and followed sheba the son of bichri but the men of judah did cleave unto their king from the jordan even to jerusalem\\xa0 and david came to his house at jerusalem and the king took the ten women his concubines whom he had left to keep the house and put them in ward and provided them with sustenance but went not in unto them so they were shut up unto the day of their death in widowhood with their husband alive s\\xa0 then said the king to amasa call me the men of judah together within three days and be thou here present\\xa0 so amasa went to call the men of judah together but he tarried longer than the set time which he had appointed him s\\xa0 and david said to abishai now will sheba the son of bichri do us more harm than did absalom take thou thy lords servants and pursue after him lest he get him fortified cities and escape out of our sight\\xa0 and there went out after him joabs men and the cherethites and the pelethites and all the mighty men and they went out of jerusalem to pursue after sheba the son of bichri\\xa0 when they were at the great stone which is in gibeon amasa came to meet them and joab was girded with his apparel of war that he had put on and thereon was a girdle with a sword fastened upon his loins in the sheath thereof and as he went forth it fell out s\\xa0 and joab said to amasa is it well with thee my brother and joab took amasa by the beard with his right hand to kiss him\\xa0 but amasa took no heed to the sword that was in joabs hand so he smote him therewith in the groin and shed out his bowels to the ground and struck him not again and he died and joab and abishai his brother pursued after sheba the son of bichri\\xa0 and there stood by him one of joabs young men and said he that favoureth joab and he that is for david let him follow joab\\xa0 and amasa lay wallowing in his blood in the midst of the highway and when the man saw that all the people stood still he carried amasa out of the highway into the field and cast a garment over him when he saw that every one that came by him stood still\\xa0 when he was removed out of the highway all the people went on after joab to pursue after sheba the son of bichri\\xa0 and he went through all the tribes of israel unto abel and to bethmaacah and all the berites s and they were gathered together and went in also after him\\xa0 and they came and besieged him in abel of bethmaacah and they cast up a mound against the city and it stood in the moat and all the people that were with joab battered the wall to throw it down\\xa0 then cried a wise woman out of the city hear hear say i pray you unto joab come near hither that i may speak with thee\\xa0 and he came near unto her and the woman said art thou joab and he answered i am then she said unto him hear the words of thy handmaid and he answered i do hear\\xa0 then she spoke saying they were wont to speak in old time saying they shall surely ask counsel at abel and so they ended the matter\\xa0 we are of them that are peaceable and faithful in israel seekest thou to destroy a city and a mother in israel why wilt thou swallow up the inheritance of the lord \\xa0 and joab answered and said far be it far be it from me that i should swallow up or destroy\\xa0 the matter is not so but a man of the hillcountry of ephraim sheba the son of bichri by name hath lifted up his hand against the king even against david deliver him only and i will depart from the city and the woman said unto joab behold his head shall be thrown to thee over the wall\\xa0 then the woman went unto all the people in her wisdom and they cut off the head of sheba the son of bichri and threw it out to joab and he blew the horn and they were dispersed from the city every man to his tent and joab returned to jerusalem unto the king s\\xa0 now joab was over all the host of israel and benaiah the son of jehoiada was over the cherethites and over the pelethites\\xa0 and adoram was over the levy and jehoshaphat the son of ahilud was the recorder\\xa0 and sheva was scribe and zadok and abiathar were priests\\xa0 and ira also the jairite was chief minister unto david s\\xa0 and there was a famine in the days of david three years year after year and david sought the face of the lord s and the lord said it is for saul and for his bloody house because he put to death the gibeonites\\xa0 and the king called the gibeonites and said unto themnow the gibeonites were not of the children of israel but of the remnant of the amorites and the children of israel had sworn unto them and saul sought to slay them in his zeal for the children of israel and judah\\xa0 and david said unto the gibeonites what shall i do for you and wherewith shall i make atonement that ye may bless the inheritance of the lord\\xa0 and the gibeonites said unto him it is no matter of silver or gold between us and saul or his house neither is it for us to put any man to death in israel and he said what say ye that i should do for you\\xa0 and they said unto the king the man that consumed us and that devised against us so that we have been destroyed from remaining in any of the borders of israel\\xa0 let seven men of his sons be delivered unto us and we will hang them up unto the lord in gibeah of saul the chosen of the lord p\\xa0and the king said i will deliver them\\xa0 but the king spared mephibosheth the son of jonathan the son of saul because of the lords oath that was between them between david and jonathan the son of saul\\xa0 but the king took the two sons of rizpah the daughter of aiah whom she bore unto saul armoni and mephibosheth and the five sons of michal the daughter of saul whom she bore to adriel the son of barzillai the meholathite\\xa0 and he delivered them into the hands of the gibeonites and they hanged them in the mountain before the lord and they fell all seven together and they were put to death in the days of harvest in the first days at the beginning of barley harvest\\xa0 and rizpah the daughter of aiah took sackcloth and spread it for her upon the rock from the beginning of harvest until water was poured upon them from heaven and she suffered neither the birds of the air to rest on them by day nor the beasts of the field by night\\xa0 and it was told david what rizpah the daughter of aiah the concubine of saul had done\\xa0 and david went and took the bones of saul and the bones of jonathan his son from the men of jabeshgilead who had stolen them from the broad place of bethshan where the philistines had hanged them in the day that the philistines slew saul in gilboa\\xa0 and he brought up from thence the bones of saul and the bones of jonathan his son and they gathered the bones of them that were hanged\\xa0 and they buried the bones of saul and jonathan his son in the country of benjamin in zela in the sepulchre of kish his father and they performed all that the king commanded and after that god was entreated for the land \\xa0 and the philistines had war again with israel and david went down and his servants with him and fought against the philistines and david waxed faint\\xa0 and ishbibenob who was of the sons of the giant the weight of whose spear was three hundred shekels of brass in weight he being girded with new armour thought to have slain david\\xa0 but abishai the son of zeruiah succoured him and smote the philistine and killed him then the men of david swore unto him saying thou shalt go no more out with us to battle that thou quench not the lamp of israel \\xa0 and it came to pass after this that there was again war with the philistines at gob then sibbecai the hushathite slew saph who was of the sons of the giant s\\xa0 and there was again war with the philistines at gob and elhanan the son of jaareoregim the bethlehemite slew goliath the gittite the staff of whose spear was like a weavers beam s\\xa0 and there was again war at gath where was a champion that had on every hand six fingers and on every foot six toes four and twenty in number and he also was born to the giant\\xa0 and when he taunted israel jonathan the son of shimea davids brother slew him\\xa0 these four were born to the giant in gath and they fell by the hand of david and by the hand of his servants \\xa0 and david spoke unto the lord the words of this song in the day that the lord delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies and out of the hand of saul\\xa0 and he said the lord is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer\\xa0 the god who is my rock in him i take refuge my shield and my horn of salvation my high tower and my refuge my saviour thou savest me from violence\\xa0 praised i cry is the lord and i am saved from mine enemies\\xa0 for the waves of death compassed me the floods of belial assailed me\\xa0 the cords of sheol surrounded me the snares of death confronted me\\xa0 in my distress i called upon the lord yea i called unto my god and out of his temple he heard my voice and my cry did enter into his ears\\xa0 then the earth did shake and quake the foundations of heaven did tremble they were shaken because he was wroth\\xa0 smoke arose up in his nostrils and fire out of his mouth did devour coals flamed forth from him\\xa0 he bowed the heavens also and came down and thick darkness was under his feet\\xa0 and he rode upon a cherub and did fly yea he was seen upon the wings of the wind\\xa0 and he made darkness pavilions round about him gathering of waters thick clouds of the skies\\xa0 at the brightness before him coals of fire flamed forth\\xa0 the lord thundered from heaven and the most high gave forth his voice\\xa0 and he sent out arrows and scattered them lightning and discomfited them\\xa0 and the channels of the sea appeared the foundations of the world were laid bare by the rebuke of the lord at the blast of the breath of his nostrils\\xa0 he sent from on high he took me he drew me out of many waters\\xa0 he delivered me from mine enemy most strong from them that hated me for they were too mighty for me\\xa0 they confronted me in the day of my calamity but the lord was a stay unto me\\xa0 he brought me forth also into a large place he delivered me because he delighted in me\\xa0 the lord rewarded me according to my righteousness according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me\\xa0 for i have kept the ways of the lord and have not wickedly departed from my god\\xa0 for all his ordinances were before me and as for his statutes i di',\n",
       "  'd not depart from them\\xa0 and i was singlehearted toward him and i kept myself from mine iniquity\\xa0 therefore hath the lord recompensed me according to my righteousness according to my cleanness in his eyes\\xa0 with the merciful thou dost show thyself merciful with the upright man thou dost show thyself upright\\xa0 with the pure thou dost show thyself pure and with the crooked thou dost show thyself subtle\\xa0 and the afflicted people thou dost save but thine eyes are upon the haughty that thou mayest humble them\\xa0 for thou art my lamp o lord and the lord doth lighten my darkness\\xa0 for by thee i run upon a troop by my god do i scale a wall\\xa0 as for god his way is perfect the word of the lord is tried he is a shield unto all them that take refuge in him\\xa0 for who is god save the lord and who is a rock save our god\\xa0 the god who is my strong fortress and who letteth my way go forth straight\\xa0 who maketh my feet like hinds and setteth me upon my high places\\xa0 who traineth my hands for war so that mine arms do bend a bow of brass\\xa0 thou hast also given me thy shield of salvation and thy condescension hath made me great\\xa0 thou hast enlarged my steps under me and my feet have not slipped\\xa0 i have pursued mine enemies and destroyed them neither did i turn back till they were consumed\\xa0 and i have consumed them and smitten them through that they cannot arise yea they are fallen under my feet\\xa0 for thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me\\xa0 thou hast also made mine enemies turn their backs unto me yea them that hate me that i might cut them off\\xa0 they looked but there was none to save even unto the lord but he answered them not\\xa0 then did i beat them small as the dust of the earth i did stamp them as the mire of the streets and did tread them down\\xa0 thou also hast delivered me from the contentions of my people thou hast kept me to be the head of the nations a people whom i have not known serve me\\xa0 the sons of the stranger dwindle away before me as soon as they hear of me they obey me\\xa0 the sons of the stranger fade away and come halting out of their close places\\xa0 the lord liveth and blessed be my rock and exalted be the god my rock of salvation\\xa0 even the god that executeth vengeance for me and bringeth down peoples under me\\xa0 and that bringeth me forth from mine enemies yea thou liftest me up above them that rise up against me thou deliverest me from the violent man\\xa0 therefore i will give thanks unto thee o lord among the nations and will sing praises unto thy name\\xa0 a tower of salvation is he to his king and showeth mercy to his anointed to david and to his seed for evermore \\xa0 now these are the last words of david the saying of david the son of jesse and the saying of the man raised on high the anointed of the god of jacob and the sweet singer of israel\\xa0 the spirit of the lord spoke by me and his word was upon my tongue\\xa0 the god of israel said the rock of israel spoke to me ruler over men shall be the righteous even he that ruleth in the fear of god\\xa0 and as the light of the morning when the sun riseth a morning without clouds when through clear shining after rain the tender grass springeth out of the earth\\xa0 for is not my house established with god for an everlasting covenant he hath made with me ordered in all things and sure for all my salvation and all my desire will he not make it to grow\\xa0 but the ungodly they are as thorns thrust away all of them for they cannot be taken with the hand\\xa0 but the man that toucheth them must be armed with iron and the staff of a spear and they shall be utterly burned with fire in their place \\xa0 these are the names of the mighty men whom david had joshebbasshebeth a tahchemonite chief of the captains the same was adino the eznite  against eight hundred whom he slew at one time s\\xa0 and after him was eleazar the son of dodo the son of an ahohite one of the three mighty men with david when they jeoparded their lives against the philistines that were there gathered together to battle and the men of israel were gone away\\xa0 he stood firm and smote the philistines until his hand was weary and his hand did cleave unto the sword and the lord wrought a great victory that day and the people returned after him only to strip the slain s\\xa0 and after him was shammah the son of age the ararite and the philistines were gathered together into a troop where was a plot of ground full of lentils and the people fled from the philistines\\xa0 but he stood in the midst of the plot and defended it and slew the philistines and the lord wrought a great victory s\\xa0 and three of the thirty chief went down and came to david in the harvest time unto the cave of adullam and the troop of the philistines were encamped in the valley of rephaim\\xa0 and david was then in the stronghold and the garrison of the philistines was then in bethlehem\\xa0 and david longed and said oh that one would give me water to drink of the well of bethlehem which is by the gate s\\xa0 and the three mighty men broke through the host of the philistines and drew water out of the well of bethlehem that was by the gate and took it and brought it to david but he would not drink thereof but poured it out unto the lord\\xa0 and he said be it far from me o lord that i should do this shall i drink the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of their lives therefore he would not drink it these things did the three mighty men s\\xa0 and abishai the brother of joab the son of zeruiah was chief of the three and he lifted up his spear against three hundred and slew them and had a name among the three\\xa0 he was most honourable of the three therefore he was made their captain howbeit he attained not unto the first three s\\xa0 and benaiah the son of jehoiada the son of a valiant man of kabzeel who had done mighty deeds he smote the two altarhearths of moab he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow\\xa0 and he slew an egyptian a goodly man and the egyptian had a spear in his hand but he went down to him with a staff and plucked the spear out of the egyptians hand and slew him with his own spear\\xa0 these things did benaiah the son of jehoiada and had a name among the three mighty men\\xa0 he was more honourable than the thirty but he attained not to the first three and david set him over his guard\\xa0 asahel the brother of joab was one of the thirty elhanan the

children of israel according unto all that the lord had given him in commandment unto them after he had smitten sihon the king of the amorites who dwelt in heshbon and og the king of bashan who dwelt in ashtaroth at edrei beyond the jordan in the land of moab took moses upon him to expound this law saying the lord our god spoke unto us in horeb saying ye have dwelt long enough in this mountain turn you and take your journey and go to the hillcountry of the amorites and unto all the places nigh thereunto in the arabah in the hillcountry and in the lowland and in the south and by the seashore the land of the canaanites and lebanon as far as the great river the river euphrates behold i have set the land before you go in and possess the land which the lord swore unto your fathers to abraham to isaac and to jacob to give unto them and to their seed after them and i spoke unto you at that time saying i am not able to bear you myself alone the lord your god hath multiplied you and behold ye are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude the lord the god of your fathers make you a thousand times so many more as ye are and bless you as he hath promised you how can i myself alone bear your cumbrance and your burden and your strife get you from each one of your tribes wise men and understanding and full of knowledge and i will make them heads over you and ye answered me and said the thing which thou hast spoken is good for us to do so i took the heads of your tribes wise men and full of knowledge and made them heads over you captains of thousands and captains of hundreds and captains of fifties and captains of tens and officers tribe by tribe and i charged your judges at that time saying hear the causes between your brethren and judge righteously between a man and his brother and the stranger that is with him ye shall not respect persons in judgment ye shall hear the small and the great alike ye shall not be afraid of the face of any man for the judgment is gods and the cause that is too hard for you ye shall bring unto me and i will hear it and i commanded you at that time all the things which ye should do and we journeyed from horeb and went through all

and the cities unto which we shall come and the thing pleased me well and i took twelve men of you one man for every tribe and they turned and went up into the mountains and came unto the valley of

way ye should go and in the cloud by day and the lord heard the voice of your words and was wroth and swore saying surely there shall not one of these men even this evil generation see the good land which i swore to give unto your fathers save caleb the son of jephunneh he shall see it and to him will i give the land that he hath trodden upon and to his children because he hath wholly followed

them go not up neither fight for i am not among you lest ye be smitten before your enemies so i spoke unto you and ye hearkened not but ye rebelled against the commandment of the lord and were

money that i may drink only let me pass through on my feet as the children of esau that dwell in seir and the moabites that dwell in ar did unto me until i shall pass over the jordan into the land which the lord our god giveth us but sihon king of heshbon would not let us pass by him for the lord thy god hardened his spirit and made his heart obstinate that he might deliver him into thy hand as appeareth this day s and the lord said unto me behold i have begun to deliver up sihon and his land before thee begin to possess his land then sihon came out against us he and all his people unto

might prove thee to do thee good at thy latter end and thou say in thy heart my power and the might of my hand hath gotten me this wealth but thou shalt remember the lord thy god for it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth that he may establish his covenant which he swore unto thy fathers as it is this day  and it shall be if thou shalt forget the lord thy god and walk after other gods and serve them and worship them i forewarn you this day that ye shall surely perish as the nations that the lord maketh to perish before you so shall ye perish because ye would not hearken unto the voice of the lord your god  hear o israel thou art to pass over the jordan this day to go in to dispossess nations greater and mightier than thyself cities great and fortified up to heaven a people great and tall the sons of the anakim whom thou knowest and of whom thou hast heard say who can stand before the sons of anak know therefore this day that the lord thy god is he who goeth over before thee as a devouring fire he will destroy them and he will bring them down before thee so shalt thou drive them out and make them to perish quickly as the lord hath spoken unto thee speak not thou in thy heart after that the lord thy god hath thrust them out from before thee saying for my righteousness the lord hath brought me in to possess this land whereas for the wickedness of these nations the lord doth drive them out from before thee not for thy righteousness or for the uprightness of thy heart dost thou go in to possess their land but for the wickedness of these nations the lord thy god doth drive them out from before thee and that he may establish the word which the lord swore unto thy fathers to abraham to isaac and to jacob know therefore that it is not for thy righteousness that the lord thy god giveth thee this good land to possess it for thou art a stiffnecked people remember forget thou not how thou didst make the lord thy god wroth in the wilderness from the day that thou didst go forth out of the land of egypt until ye came unto this place ye have been rebellious against the lord also in horeb ye made the lord wroth and the lord was angered with you to have destroyed you when i was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone even the tables of the covenant which the lord made with you then i abode in the mount forty days and forty nights i did neither eat bread nor drink water and the lord delivered unto me the two tables of stone written with the finger of god and on them was written according to all the words which the lord spoke with you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly and it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights that the lord gave me the two tables of stone even the tables of the covenant and the lord said unto me arise get thee down quickly from hence for thy people that thou hast brought forth out of egypt have dealt corruptly they are quickly turned aside out of the way which i commanded them they have made them a molten image furthermore the lord spoke unto me saying i have seen this people and behold it is a stiffnecked people let me alone that i may destroy them and blot out their name from under heaven and i will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than they so i turned and came down from the mount and the mount burned with fire and the two tables of the covenant were in my two hands and i looked and behold ye had sinned against the lord your god ye had made you a molten calf ye had turned aside quickly out of the way which the lord had commanded you and i took hold of the two tables and cast them out of my two hands and broke them before your eyes and i fell down before the lord as at the first forty days and forty nights i did neither eat bread nor drink water because of all your sin which ye sinned in doing that which was evil in the sight of the lord to provoke him for i was in dread of the anger and hot displeasure wherewith the lord was wroth against you to destroy you but the lord hearkened unto me that time also moreover the lord was very angry with aaron to have destroyed him and i prayed for aaron also the same time and i took your sin the calf which ye had made and burnt it with fire and beat it in pieces grinding it very small until it was as fine as dust and i cast the dust thereof into the brook that descended out of the mount and at taberah and at massah and at kibrothhattaavah ye made the lord wroth and when the lord sent you from kadeshbarnea saying go up and possess the land which i have given you then ye rebelled against the commandment of the lord your god and ye believed him not nor hearkened to his voice ye have been rebellious against the lord from the day that i knew you so i fell down before the lord the forty days and forty nights that i fell down because the lord had said he would destroy you and i prayed unto the lord and said o lord god destroy not thy people and thine inheritance that thou hast redeemed through thy greatness that thou hast brought forth out of egypt with a mighty hand remember thy servants abraham isaac and jacob look not unto the stubbornness of this people nor to their wickedness nor to their sin lest the land whence thou broughtest us out say because the lord was not able to bring them into the land which he promised unto them and because he hated them he',\n",
       "  ' hath brought them out to slay them in the wilderness yet they are thy people and thine inheritance that thou didst bring out by thy great power and by thy outstretched arm  at that time the lord said unto me hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first and come up unto me into the mount and make thee an ark of wood and i will write on the tables the words that were on the first tables which thou didst break and thou shalt put them in the ark so i made an ark of acaciawood and hewed two tables of stone like unto the first and went up into the mount having the two tables in my hand and he wrote on the tables according to the first writing the ten words which the lord spoke unto you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly and the lord gave them unto me and i turned and came down from the mount and put the tables in the ark which i had made and there they are as the lord commanded me and the children of israel journeyed from beerothbenejaakan to moserah there aaron died and there he was buried and eleazar his son ministered in the priests office in his stead from thence they journeyed unto gudgod and from gudgod to jotbah a land of brooks of water at that time the lord separated the tribe of levi to bear the ark of the covenant of the lord to stand before the lord to minister unto him and to bless in his name unto this day wherefore levi hath no portion nor inheritance with his brethren the lord is his inheritance according as the lord thy god spoke unto him now i stayed in the mount as at the first time forty days and forty nights and the lord hearkened unto me that time also the lord would not destroy thee and the lord said unto me arise go before the people causing them to set forward that they may go in and possess the land which i swore unto their fathers to give unto them  and now israel what doth the lord thy god require of thee but to fear the lord thy god to walk in all his ways and to love him and to serve the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul to keep for thy good the commandments of the lord and his statutes which i command thee this day behold unto the lord thy god belongeth the heaven and the heaven of heavens the earth with all that therein is only the lord had a delight in thy fathers to love them and he chose their seed after them even you above all peoples as it is this day circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart and be no more stiffnecked for the lord your god he is god of gods and lord of lords the great god the mighty and the awful who regardeth not persons nor taketh reward he doth execute justice for the fatherless and widow and loveth the stranger in giving him food and raiment love ye therefore the stranger for ye were strangers in the land of egypt thou shalt fear the lord thy god him shalt thou serve and to him shalt thou cleave and by his name shalt thou swear he is thy glory and he is thy god that hath done for thee these great and tremendous things which thine eyes have seen thy fathers went down into egypt with threescore and ten persons and now the lord thy god hath made thee as the stars of heaven for multitude therefore thou shalt love the lord thy god and keep his charge and his statutes and his ordinances and his commandments alway and know ye this day for i speak not with your children that have not known and that have not seen the chastisement of the lord your god his greatness his mighty hand and his outstretched arm and his signs and his works which he did in the midst of egypt unto pharaoh the king of egypt and unto all his land and what he did unto the army of egypt unto their horses and to their chariots how he made the water of the red sea to overflow them as they pursued after you and how the lord hath destroyed them unto this day and what he did unto you in the wilderness until ye came unto this place and what he did unto dathan and abiram the sons of eliab the son of reuben how the earth opened her mouth and swallowed them up and their households and their tents and every living substance that followed them in the midst of all israel but your eyes have seen all the great work of the lord which he did therefore shall ye keep all the commandment which i command thee this day that ye may be strong and go in and possess the land whither ye go over to possess it and that ye may prolong your days upon the land which the lord swore unto your fathers to give unto them and to their seed a land flowing with milk and honey s for the land whither thou goest in to possess it is not as the land of egypt from whence ye came out where thou didst sow thy seed and didst water it with thy foot as a garden of herbs but the land whither ye go over to possess it is a land of hills and valleys and drinketh water as the rain of heaven cometh down a land which the lord thy god careth for the eyes of the lord thy god are always upon it from the beginning of the year even unto the end of the year s and it shall come to pass if ye shall hearken diligently unto my commandments which i command you this day to love the lord your god and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul that i will give the rain of your land in its season the former rain and the latter rain that thou mayest gather in thy corn and thy wine and thine oil and i will give grass in thy fields for thy cattle and thou shalt eat and be satisfied take heed to yourselves lest your heart be deceived and ye turn aside and serve other gods and worship them and the anger of the lord be kindled against you and he shut up the heaven so that there shall be no rain and the ground shall not yield her fruit and ye perish quickly from off the good land which the lord giveth you therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul and ye shall bind them for a sign upon your hand and they shall be for frontlets between your eyes and ye shall teach them your children talking of them when thou sittest in thy house and when thou walkest by the way and when thou liest down and when thou risest up and thou shalt write them upon the doorposts of thy house and upon thy gates that your days may be multiplied and the days of your children upon the land which the lord swore unto your fathers to give them as the days of the heavens above the earth s for if ye shall diligently keep

say because they forsook the covenant of the lord the god of their fathers which he made with them when he brought them forth out of the land of egypt and went and served other gods and worshipped them gods that they knew not and that he had not allotted unto them therefore the anger of the lord was kindled against this land to bring upon it all the curse that is written in this book and the

god will make thee overabundant in all the work of thy hand in the fruit of thy body and in the fruit of thy cattle and in the fruit of thy land for good for the lord will again rejoice over thee for good as he rejoiced over thy fathers if thou shalt hearken to the voice of the lord thy god to keep his commandments and his statutes which are written in this book of the law if thou turn unto the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul s for this commandment which i command thee this day it is not too hard for thee neither is it far off it is not in heaven that thou shouldest say

us and make us to hear it that we may do it but the word is very nigh unto thee in thy mouth and in thy heart that thou mayest do it s see i have set before thee this day life and good and death and evil in that i command thee this day to love the lord thy god to walk in his ways and to keep his commandments and his statutes and his ordinances then thou shalt live and multiply and the lord thy

this day that ye shall surely perish ye shall not prolong your days upon the land whither thou passest over the jordan to go in to possess it i call heaven and earth to witness against you this day

give them and thou shalt cause them to inherit it and the lord he it is that doth go before thee he will be with thee he will not fail thee neither forsake thee fear not neither be dismayed and moses wrote this law and delivered it unto the priests the sons of levi that bore the ark of the covenant of the lord and unto all the elders of israel and moses commanded them saying at the end of every seven years in the set time of the year of release in the feast of tabernacles when all israel is come to appear before the lord thy god in the place which he shall choose thou shalt read this law

thy rebellion and thy stiff neck behold while i am yet alive with you this day ye have been rebellious against the lord and how much more after my death assemble unto me all the elders of your tribes and your officers that i may speak these words in their ears and call heaven and earth to witness against them for i know that after my death ye will in any wise deal corruptly and turn aside from the way which i have commanded you and evil will befall you in the end of days because ye will do that which is evil in the sight of the lord to provoke him through the work of your hands and moses spoke in the ears of all the assembly of israel the words of this song until they were finished  give ear ye heavens and i will speak and let the earth hear the words of my mouth my doctrine shall drop as the rain my speech shall distil as the dew as the small rain upon the tender grass and as the showers upon the herb for i will proclaim the name of the lord ascribe ye greatness unto our god the rock his work is perfect for all his ways are justice a god of faithfulness and without iniquity just and right is he is corruption his no his childrens is the blemish a generation crooked and perverse do ye thus requite the lord o foolish people and unwise is not he thy father that hath gotten thee hath he not made thee and established thee remember the days of old consider the years of many generations ask thy father and he will declare unto thee thine elders and they will tell thee when the most high gave to the nations their inheritance when he separated the children of men he set the borders of the peoples according to the number of the children of israel for the portion of the lord is his people jacob the lot of his inheritance he found him in a desert land and in the waste a howling wilderness he compassed him about he cared for him he kept him as the apple of his eye as an eagle that stirreth up her nest hovereth over her young spreadeth abroad her wings taketh them beareth them on her pinions the lord alone did lead him and there was no strange god with him he made him ride on the high places of the earth and he did eat the fruitage of the field and he made him

of the grape thou drankest foaming wine but jeshurun waxed fat and kickedthou didst wax fat thou didst grow thick thou didst become grossand he forsook god who made him and contemned the rock of his salvation they roused him to jealousy with strange gods with abominations did they provoke him they sacrificed unto demons nogods gods that they knew not new gods that came up of late which your fathers dreaded not of the rock that begot thee thou wast unmindful and didst forget god that bore thee and the lord saw and spurned because of the provoking of his sons and his daughters and he said i will hide my face from them i will see what their end shall be for they are a very froward generation children in whom is no faithfulness they have roused me to jealousy with a nogod they have provoked me with their vanities and i will rouse them to jealousy with a nopeople i will provoke them with a vile nation for a fire is kindled in my nostril and burneth unto the depths of the

understanding in them if they were wise they would understand this they would discern their latter end how should one chase a thousand and two put ten thousand to flight except their rock had given them over and the lord had delivered them up for their rock is not as our rock even our enemies themselves being judges for their vine is of the vine of sodom and of the fields of gomorrah their

them set your heart unto all the words wherewith i testify against you this day that ye may charge your children therewith to observe to do all the words of this law for it is no vain thing for you because it is your life and through this thing ye shall prolong your days upon the land whither ye go over the jordan to possess it  and the lord spoke unto moses that selfsame day saying get thee up into this mountain of abarim unto mount nebo which is in the land of moab that is over against jericho and behold the land of canaan which i give unto the children of israel for a possession and die in the mount whither thou goest up and be gathered unto thy people as aaron thy brother died in mount hor and was gathered unto his people because ye trespassed against me in the midst of the children of israel at the waters of meribathkadesh in the wilderness of zin because ye sanctified me not in the midst of the children of israel for thou shalt see the land afar off but thou shalt not go thither into the land which i give the children of israel  and this is the blessing wherewith moses the man of god blessed the children of israel before his death and he said the lord came from sinai and rose from seir unto them he shined forth from mount paran and he came from the myriads holy at his right hand was a fiery law unto them yea he loveth the peoples all his holy onesthey are in thy hand and they sit down at thy feet receiving of thy words moses commanded us a law an inheritance of the congregation of jacob and there was a king in jeshurun when the heads of the people were gathered all the tribes of israel together let reuben live and not die in that his men become few s and this for judah and he said hear lord the voice of judah and bring him in unto his people his hands shall contend for him and thou shalt be a help against his adversaries  and of levi he said thy thummim and thy urim be with thy holy one whom thou didst prove at massah with whom thou didst strive at the waters of meribah who said of his father and of his mother i have not seen him neither did he acknowledge his brethren nor knew he his own children for they have observed thy word and keep thy covenant they shall teach jacob thine ordinances and israel thy law they shall put incense before thee and whole burntoffering upon thine altar bless lord his substance and accept the work of his hands smite through the loins of them that rise up against him and of them that hate him that they rise not again s of benjamin he said the beloved of the lord shall dwell in safety by him he covereth him all the day and he dwelleth between his shoulders s and of joseph he said blessed of the lord be his land for the precious things of heaven for the dew and for the deep that coucheth beneath and for the precious things of the fruits of the sun and for the precious things of the yield of the moons and for the tops of the ancient mountains and for the precious things of the everlasting hills and for the precious things of the earth and the fulness thereof and the good will of him that dwelt in the bush let the blessing come upon the head of joseph and upon the crown of the head of him that is prince among his brethren his firstling bullock majesty is his and his horns are the horns of the wildox with them he shall gore the peoples all of them even the ends of the earth and they are the ten thousands of ephraim and they are the thousands of manasseh s and of zebulun he said rejoice zebulun in thy going out and issachar in thy tents they shall call peoples unto the mountain there shall they offer sacrifices of righteousness for they shall suck the abundance of the seas and the hidden treasures of the sand s and of gad he said blessed be he that enlargeth gad he dwelleth as a lioness and teareth the arm yea the crown of the head and he chose a first part for himself for there a portion of a ruler was reserved and there came the heads of the people he executed the righteousness of the lord and his ordinances with israel s and of dan he said dan is a lions whelp that leapeth forth from bashan and of naphtali he said o naphtali satisfied with favour and full with the blessing of the lord possess thou the sea and the south s and of asher he said blessed be asher above sons let him be the favoured of his brethren and let him dip his foot in oil iron and brass shall be thy bars and as thy days so shall thy strength be there is none like unto god o jeshurun who rideth upon the heaven as thy help and in his excellency on the skies the eternal god is a dwellingplace and underneath are the everlasting arms and he thrust out the enemy from before thee and said destroy and israel dwelleth in safety the fountain of jacob alone in a land of corn and wine yea his heavens drop down dew happy art thou o israel who is like unto thee a people saved by the lord the shield of thy help and that is the sword of thy excellency and thine enemies shall dwindle away before thee and thou shalt tread upon their high places s and moses went up from the plains of moab unto mount nebo to the top of pisgah that is over against jericho and the lord showed him all the land even gilead as far as dan and all naphtali and the land of ephraim and manasseh and all the land of judah as far as the hinder sea and the south and the plain even the valley of jericho the city of palmtrees as far as zoar and the lord said unto him this is the land which i swore unto abraham unto isaac and unto jacob saying i will give it unto thy seed i have caused thee to see it with thine eyes but thou shalt not go over thither so moses the servant of the lord died there in the land of moab according to the word of the lord and he was buried in the valley in the land of moab over against bethpeor and no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day and moses was a hundred and twenty years old when he died his eye was not dim nor his natural force abated and the children of israel wept for moses in the plains of moab thirty days so the days of weeping in the mourning for moses were ended and joshua the son of nun was full of the spirit of wisdom for moses had laid his hands upon him and the children of israel hearkened unto him and did as the lord commanded moses and there hath not arisen a prophet since in israel like unto moses whom the lord knew face to face in all the signs and the wonders which the lord sent him to do in the land of egypt to pharaoh and to all his servants and to all his land and in all the mighty hand and in all the great terror which moses wrought in the sigh'],\n",
       " [' the words of jeremiah the son of hilkiah of the priests that were in anathoth in the land of benjamin to whom the word of the lord came in the days of josiah the son of amon king of judah in the thirteenth year of his reign it came also in the days of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah unto the end of the eleventh year of zedekiah the son of josiah king of judah unto the carrying away of jerusalem captive in the fifth month  and the word of the lord came unto me saying before i formed thee in the belly i knew thee and before thou camest forth out of the womb i sanctified thee i have appointed thee a prophet unto the nations then said i ah lord god behold i cannot speak for i am a child s but the lord said unto me say not i am a child for to whomsoever i shall send thee thou shalt go and whatsoever i shall command thee thou shalt speak be not afraid of them for i am with thee to deliver thee saith the lord then the lord put forth his hand and touched my mouth and the lord said unto me behold i have put my words in thy mouth see i have this day set thee over the nations and over the kingdoms to root out and to pull down and to destroy and to overthrow to build and to plant  moreover the word of the lord came unto me saying jeremiah what seest thou and i said i see a rod of an almondtree then said the lord unto me thou hast well seen for i watch over my word to perform it s and the word of the lord came unto me the second time saying what seest thou and i said i see a seething pot and the face thereof is from the north then the lord said unto me out of the north the evil shall break forth upon all the inhabitants of the land for lo i will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north saith the lord and they shall come and they shall set every one his throne at the entrance of the gates of jerusalem and against all the walls thereof round about and against all the cities of judah and i will utter my judgments against them touching all their wickedness in that they have forsaken me and have offered unto other gods and worshipped the work of their own hands thou therefore gird up thy loins and arise and speak unto them all that i command thee be not dismayed at them lest i dismay thee before them for behold i have made thee this day a fortified city and an iron pillar and brazen walls against the whole land against the kings of judah against the princes thereof against the priests thereof and against the people of the land and they shall fight against thee but they shall not prevail against thee for i am with thee saith the lord to deliver thee  and the word of the lord came to me saying go and cry in the ears of jerusalem saying thus saith the lord i remember for thee the affection of thy youth the love of thine espousals how thou wentest after me in the wilderness in a land that was not sown israel is the lords hallowed portion his firstfruits of the increase all that devour him shall be held guilty evil shall come upon them saith the lord  hear ye the word of the lord o house of jacob and all the families of the house of israel thus saith the lord what unrighteousness have your fathers found in me that they are gone far from me and have walked after things of nought and are become nought neither said they where is the lord that brought us up out of the land of egypt that led us through the wilderness through a land of deserts and of pits through a land of drought and of the shadow of death through a land that no man passed through and where no man dwelt and i brought you into a land of fruitful fields to eat the fruit thereof and the good thereof but when ye entered ye defiled my land and made my heritage an abomination the priests said not where is the lord and they that handle the law knew me not and the rulers transgressed against me the prophets also prophesied by baal and walked after things that do not profit wherefore i will yet plead with you saith the lord and with your childrens children will i plead for pass over to the isles of the kittites and see and send unto kedar and consider diligently and see if there hath been such a thing hath a nation changed its gods which yet are no gods but my people hath changed its glory for that which doth not profit be astonished o ye heavens at this and be horribly afraid be ye exceeding amazed saith the lord for my people have committed two evils they have forsaken me the fountain of living waters and hewed them out cisterns broken cisterns that can hold no water is israel a servant is he a homeborn slave why is he become a prey the young lions have roared upon him and let their voice resound and they have made his land desolate his cities are laid waste without inhabitant the children also of noph and tahpanhes feed upon the crown of thy head is it not this that doth cause it unto thee that thou hast forsaken the lord thy god when he led thee by the way and now what hast thou to do in the way to egypt to drink the waters of shihor or what hast thou to do in the way to assyria to drink the waters of the river thine own wickedness shall correct thee and thy backslidings shall reprove thee know therefore and see that it is an evil and a bitter thing that thou hast forsaken the lord thy god neither is my fear in thee saith the lord god of hosts for of old time i have broken thy yoke and burst thy bands and thou saidst i will not transgress upon every high hill and under every leafy tree thou didst recline playing the harlot yet i had planted thee a noble vine wholly a right seed how then art thou turned into the degenerate plant of a strange vine unto me for though thou wash thee with nitre and take thee much soap yet thine iniquity is marked before me saith the lord god how canst thou say i am not defiled i have not gone after the baalim see thy way in the valley know what thou hast done thou art a swift young camel traversing her ways a wild ass used to the wilderness that snuffeth up the wind in her desire her lust who can hinder it all they that seek her will not weary themselves in her month they shall find her withhold thy foot from being unshod and thy throat from thirst but thou saidst there is no hope no for i have loved strangers and after them will i go as the thief is ashamed when he is found so is the house of israel ashamed they their kings their princes and their priests and their prophets who say to a stock thou art my father and to a stone thou hast brought us forth for they have turned their back unto me and not their face but in the time of their trouble they will say arise and save us but where are thy gods that thou hast made thee let them arise if they can save thee in the time of thy trouble for according to the number of thy cities are thy gods o judah s wherefore will ye contend with me ye all have transgressed against me saith the lord in vain have i smitten your childrenthey received no correction your sword hath devoured your prophets like a destroying lion o generation see ye the word of the lord have i been a wilderness unto israel or a land of thick darkness wherefore say my people we roam at large we will come no more unto thee can a maid forget her ornaments or a bride her attire yet my people have forgotten me days without number how trimmest thou thy way to seek love thereforeeven the wicked women hast thou taught thy ways also in thy skirts is found the blood of the souls of the innocent poor thou didst not find them breaking in yet for all these things thou saidst i am innocent surely his anger is turned away from mebehold i will enter into judgment with thee because thou sayest i have not sinned how greatly dost thou cheapen thyself to change thy way thou shalt be ashamed of egypt also as thou wast ashamed of asshur from him also shalt thou go forth with thy hands upon thy head for the lord hath rejected them in whom thou didst trust and thou shalt not prosper in them  saying if a man put away his wife and she go from him and become another mans may he return unto her again will not that land be greatly polluted but thou hast played the harlot with many lovers and wouldest thou yet return to me saith the lord lift up thine eyes unto the high hills and see where hast thou not been lain with by the ways hast thou sat for them as an arabian in the wilderness and thou hast polluted the land with thy harlotries and with thy wickedness therefore the showers have been withheld and there hath been no latter rain yet thou hadst a harlots forehead thou refusedst to be ashamed didst thou not just now cry unto me my father thou art the friend of my youth will he bear grudge for ever will he keep it to the end behold thou hast spoken but hast done evil things and hast had thy way  and the lord said unto me in the days of josiah the king hast thou seen that which backsliding israel did she went up upon every high mountain and under every leafy tree and there played the harlot and i said after she hath done all these things she will return unto me but she returned not and her treacherous sister judah saw it and i saw when forasmuch as backsliding israel had committed adultery i had put her away and given her a bill of divorcement that yet treacherous judah her sister feared not but she also went and played the harlot and it came to pass through the lightness of her harlotry that the land was polluted and she committed adultery with stones and with stocks and yet for all this her treacherous sister judah hath not returned unto me with her whole heart but feignedly saith the lord s even the lord said unto mebacksliding israel hath proved herself more righteous than treacherous judah go and proclaim these words toward the north and say return thou backsliding israel saith the lord i will not frown upon you for i am merciful saith the lord i will not bear grudge for ever only acknowledge thine iniquity that thou hast transgressed against the lord thy god and hast scattered thy ways to the strangers under every leafy tree and ye have not hearkened to my voice saith the lord return o backsliding children saith the lord for i am a lord unto you and i will take you one of a city and two of a family and i will bring you to zion and i will give you shepherds according to my heart who shall feed you with knowledge and understanding and it shall come to pass when ye are multiplied and increased in the land in those days saith the lord they shall say no more the ark of the covenant of the lord neither shall it come to mind neither shall they make mention of it neither shall they miss it neither shall it be made any more at that time they shall call jerusalem the throne of the lord and all the nations shall be gathered unto it to the name of the lord to jerusalem neither shall they walk any more after the stubbornness of their evil heart s in those days the house of judah shall walk with the house ',\n",

give thee a pleasant land the goodliest heritage of the nations and i said thou shalt call me my father and shalt not turn away from following me surely as a wife treacherously departeth from her husband so have ye dealt treacherously with me o house of israel saith the lord hark upon the high hills is heard the suppliant weeping of the children of israel for that they have perverted their way they have forgotten the lord their god return ye backsliding children i will heal your backslidingshere we are we are come unto thee for thou art the lord our god truly vain have proved the hills the uproar on the mountains truly in the lord our god is the salvation of israel but the shameful thing hath devoured the labour of our fathers from our youth their flocks and their herds their sons and their daughters let us lie down in our shame and let our confusion cover us for we have sinned against the lord our god we and our fathers from our youth even unto this day and we have not hearkened to the voice of the lord our god s if thou wilt return o israel saith the lord yea return unto me and if thou wilt put away thy detestable things out of my sight and wilt not waver and wilt swear as the lord liveth in truth in justice and in righteousness then shall the nations bless themselves by him and in him shall they glory s for thus saith the lord to the men of judah and to jerusalem break up for you a fallow ground and sow not among thorns circumcise yourselves to the lord and take away the foreskins of your heart ye men of judah and inhabitants of jerusalem lest my fury go forth like fire and burn that none can quench it because of the evil of your doings declare ye in judah and publish in jerusalem and say blow ye the horn in the land cry aloud and say assemble yourselves and let us go into the fortified cities set up a standard toward zion put yourselves under covert stay not for i will bring evil from the north and a great destruction a lion is gone up from his thicket and a destroyer of nations is set out gone forth from his place to make thy land desolate that thy cities be laid waste without inhabitant for this gird you with sackcloth lament and wail for the fierce anger of the lord is not turned back from us  and it shall come to pass at that day saith the lord that the heart of the king shall fail and the heart of the princes and the priests shall be astonished and the prophets shall wonder s then said i ah lord god surely thou hast greatly deceived this people and jerusalem saying ye shall have peace whereas the sword reacheth unto the soul at that time shall it be said of this people and of jerusalem a hot wind of the high hills in the wilderness toward the daughter of my people not to fan nor to cleanse a wind too strong for this shall come for me now will i also utter judgments against them behold he cometh up as clouds and his chariots are as the whirlwind his horses are swifter than eagleswoe unto us for we are undone o jerusalem wash thy heart from wickedness that thou mayest be saved how long shall thy baleful thoughts lodge within thee for hark one declareth from dan and announceth calamity from the hills of ephraim make ye mention to the nations beholdpublish concerning jerusalemwatchers come from a far country and give out their voice against the cities of judah as keepers of a field are they against her round about

my bowels i writhe in pain the chambers of my heart my heart moaneth within me i cannot hold my peace because thou hast heard o my soul the sound of the horn the alarm of war destruction followeth upon destruction for the whole land is spoiled suddenly are my tents spoiled my curtains in a moment how long shall i see the standard shall i hear the sound of the horn  for my people is foolish they know me not they are sottish children and they have no understanding they are wise to do evil but to do good they have no knowledge i beheld the earth and lo it was waste and void and the heavens and they had no light i beheld the mountains and lo they trembled and all the hills moved to and fro i beheld and lo there was no man and all the birds of the heavens were fled i beheld and lo the fruitful field was a wilderness and all the cities thereof were broken down at the presence of the lord and before his fierce anger s for thus saith the lord the whole land shall be desolate yet will i not make a full end for this shall the earth mourn and the heavens above be black because i have spoken it i have purposed it and i have not repented neither will i turn back from it for the noise of the horsemen and bowmen the whole city fleeth they go into the thickets and climb up upon the rocks every city is forsaken and not a man dwelleth therein and thou that art spoiled what doest thou that thou clothest thyself with scarlet that thou deckest thee with ornaments of gold that thou enlargest thine eyes with paint in vain dost thou make thyself fair thy lovers despise thee they seek thy life for i have heard a voice as of a woman in travail the anguish as of her that bringeth forth her first child the voice of the daughter of zion that gaspeth for breath that spreadeth her hands

any that doeth justly that seeketh truth and i will pardon her and though they say as the lord liveth surely they swear falsely o lord are not thine eyes upon truth thou hast stricken them but they were not affected thou hast consumed them but they have refused to receive correction they have made their faces harder than a rock they have refused to return and i said surely these are poor they are foolish for they know not the way of the lord nor the ordinance of their god i will get me unto the great men and will speak unto them for they know the way of the lord and the ordinance of their

i had fed them to the full they committed adultery and assembled themselves in troops at the harlots houses they are become as wellfed horses lusty stallions every one neigheth after his neighbours wife shall i not punish for these things saith the lord and shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this s go ye up into her rows and destroy but make not a full end take away her shoots for they are not the lords for the house of israel and the house of judah have dealt very treacherously against me saith the lord they have belied the lord and said it is not he neither shall evil come upon us neither shall we see sword nor famine and the prophets shall become wind and the word is not in them thus be it done unto them s wherefore thus saith the lord the god of hosts because ye speak this word behold i will make my words in thy mouth fire and this people wood and it shall devour them lo i will bring a nation upon you from far o house of israel saith the lord it is an enduring nation it is an ancient nation a nation whose language thou knowest not neither understandest what they say their quiver is an open sepulchre they are all mighty men and they shall eat up thy harvest and thy bread they shall eat up thy sons and thy daughters they shall eat up thy flocks and thy herds they shall eat up thy vines and thy figtrees they shall batter thy fortified cities wherein thou trusteth with the sword but even in those days saith the lord i will not make a full end with you and it shall come to pass when ye shall say wherefore hath the lord our god done all these things unto us then shalt thou say unto them like as ye have forsaken me and served strange gods in your land so shall ye serve strangers in a land that is not yours  declare ye this in the house of jacob and announce it in judah saying hear now this o foolish people and without understanding that have eyes and see not that have ears and hear not fear ye not me saith the lord will ye not tremble at my presence who have placed the sand for the bound of the sea an everlasting ordinance which it cannot pass and though the waves thereof toss themselves yet can they not prevail though they roar yet can they not pass over it but this people hath a revolting and a rebellious heart they are revolted and gone neither say they in their heart let us now fear the lord our god that giveth the former rain and the latter in due season that keepeth for us the appointed weeks of the harvest your iniquities have turned away these things and your sins have withholden good from you for among my people are found wicked men they pry as fowlers lie in wait they set a trap they catch men as a cage is full of birds so are their houses full of deceit therefore they are become great and waxen rich they are waxen fat they are become sleek yea they overpass in deeds of wickedness they plead not the cause the cause of the fatherless that they might make it to prosper and the right of the needy do they not judge shall i not punish for these things saith the lord shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this s an appalling and horrible thing is come to pass in the land the prophets prophesy in the service of falsehood and the priests bear rule at their beck and my people love to have it so what then will ye do in the end thereof put yourselves under covert ye children of benjamin away from

noon woe unto us for the day declineth for the shadows of the evening are stretched out arise and let us go up by night and let us destroy her palaces  for thus hath the lord of hosts said hew ye down her trees and cast up a mound against jerusalem this is the city to be punished everywhere there is oppression in the midst of her as a ciste',\n",

alienated from thee lest i make thee desolate a land not inhabited  thus saith the lord of hosts they shall thoroughly glean as a vine the remnant of israel turn again thy hand as a grapegatherer upon the shoots to whom shall i speak and give warning that they may hear behold their ear is dull and they cannot attend behold the word of the lord is become unto them a reproach they have no delight in it therefore i am full of the fury of the lord i am weary with holding in pour it out upon the babes in the street and upon the assembly of young men together for even the husband with the wife shall be taken the aged with him that is full of days and their houses shall be turned unto others their fields and their wives together for i will stretch out my hand upon the inhabitants of the land saith the lord for from the least of them even unto the greatest of them every one is greedy for gain and from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely they have healed also the hurt of my people lightly saying peace peace when there is no peace they shall be put to shame because they have committed abomination yea they are not at all ashamed neither know they how to blush therefore they shall fall among them that fall at the time that i punish them they shall stumble saith the lord s thus saith the lord stand ye in the ways and see and ask for the old paths where is the good way and walk therein and ye shall find rest for your souls but they said we will not walk therein and i set watchmen over you attend to the sound of the horn but they said we will not attend therefore hear ye nations and know o congregation what is against them hear o earth behold i will bring evil upon this people even the fruit of their thoughts because they have not attended unto my words and as for my teaching they have rejected it to what purpose is to me the frankincense that cometh from sheba and the sweet cane from a far country your burntofferings are not acceptable nor your sacrifices pleasing unto me therefore thus saith the lord behold i will lay stumblingblocks before this people and the fathers and the sons together shall stumble against them the neighbour and his friend and they shall perish  thus saith the lord behold a people cometh from the north country and a great nation shall be roused from the uttermost parts of the earth they lay hold on bow and spear they are cruel and have no compassion their voice is like the roaring sea and they ride upon horses set in array as a man for war against thee o daughter of zion we have heard the fame thereof our hands wax feeble anguish hath taken hold of us and pain as of a woman in travail go not forth into the field nor walk by the way for there is the sword of the enemy and terror on every side o daughter of my people gird thee with sackcloth and wallow thyself in ashes make thee mourning as for an only son most bitter lamentation for the spoiler shall suddenly come upon us i have made thee a tower and a fortress among my people that thou mayest know and try their way they are all grievous revolters going about with slanders they are brass and iron they all of them deal corruptly the bellows blow fiercely the lead is consumed of the fire in vain doth the founder refine for the wicked are not separated refuse silver shall men call them because the lord hath rejected them  the word that came to jeremiah from the lord saying stand in the gate of the lords house and proclaim there this word and say hear the word of the lord all ye of judah that enter in at these gates to worship the lord s thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel amend your ways and your doings and i will cause you to dwell in this place trust ye not in lying words saying the temple of the lord the temple of the lord the temple of the lord are these nay but if ye thoroughly amend your ways and your doings if ye thoroughly execute justice between a man and his neighbour if ye oppress not the stranger the fatherless and the widow and shed not innocent blood in this place neither walk after other gods to your hurt then will i cause you to dwell in this place in the land that i gave to your fathers for ever and ever behold ye trust in lying words that cannot profit will ye steal murder and commit adultery and swear falsely and offer unto baal and walk after other gods whom ye have not known and come and stand before me in this house whereupon my name is called and say we are delivered that ye may do all these abominations is this house whereupon my name is called become a den of robbers in your eyes behold i even i have seen it saith the lord for go ye now unto my place which was in shiloh where i caused my name to dwell at the first and see what i did to it for the wickedness of my people israel and now because ye have done all these works saith the lord and i spoke unto you speaking betimes and often but ye heard not and i called you but ye answered not therefore will i do unto the house whereupon my name is called wherein ye trust and unto the place which i gave to you and to your fathers as i have done to shiloh and i will cast you out of my sight as i have cast out all your brethren even the whole seed of ephraim  therefore pray not thou for this people neither lift up cry nor prayer for them neither make intercession to me for i will not hear thee seest thou not what they do in the cities of judah and in the streets of jerusalem the children gather wood and the fathers kindle the fire and the women knead the dough to make cakes to the queen of heaven and to pour out drinkofferings unto other gods that they may provoke me do they provoke me saith the lord do they not provoke themselves to the confusion of their own faces therefore thus saith the lord god behold mine anger and my fury shall be poured out upon this place upon man and upon beast and upon the trees of the field and upon the fruit of the land and it shall burn and shall not be quenched  thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel add your burntofferings unto your sacrifices and eat ye flesh for i spoke not unto your fathers nor commanded them in the day that i brought them out of the land of egypt concerning burntofferings or sacrifices but this thing i commanded them saying hearken unto my voice and i will be your god and ye shall be my people and walk ye in all the way that i command you that it may be well with you but they hearkened not nor inclined their ear but walked in their own counsels even in the stubbornness of their evil heart and went backward and not forward even since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of egypt unto this day and though i have sent unto you all my servants the prophets sending them daily betimes and often yet they hearkened not unto me nor inclined their ear but made their neck stiff they did worse than their fathers and thou shalt speak all these words unto them but they will not hearken to thee thou shalt also call unto them but they will not answer thee therefore thou shalt say unto them this is the nation that hath not hearkened to the voice of the lord their god nor received correction faithfulness is perished and is cut off from their mouth s cut off thy hair and cast it away and take up a lamentation on the high hills for the lord hath rejected and forsaken the generation of his wrath for the children of judah have done that which is evil in my sight saith the lord they have set their detestable things in the house whereon my name is called to defile it and they have built the high places of topheth which is in the valley of the son of hinnom to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire which i commanded not neither came it into my mind  therefore behold the days come saith the lord that it shall no more be called topheth nor the valley of the son of hinnom but the valley of slaughter for they shall bury in topheth for lack of room and the carcasses of this people shall be food for the fowls of the heaven and for the beasts of the earth and none shall frighten them away then will i cause to cease from the cities of judah and from the streets of jerusalem the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride for the land shall be desolate at that time saith the lord they shall bring out the bones of the kings of judah and the bones of his princes and the bones of the priests and the bones of the prophets and the bones of the inhabitants of jerusalem out of their graves and they shall spread them before the sun and the moon and all the host of heaven whom they have loved and whom they have served and after whom they have walked and whom they have sought and whom they have worshipped they shall not be gathered nor be buried they shall be for dung upon the face of the earth and death shall be chosen rather than life by all the residue that remain of this evil family that remain in all the places whither i have driven them saith the lord of hosts s moreover thou shalt say unto them thus saith the lord do men fall and not rise up again doth one turn away and not return why then is this people of jerusalem slidden back by a perpetual backsliding they hold fast deceit they refuse to return i attended and listened but they spoke not aright no man repenteth him of his wickedness saying what have i done every one turneth away in his course as a horse that rusheth headlong in the battle yea the stork in the heaven knoweth her appointed times and the turtle and the swallow and the crane observe the time of their coming but my people know not the ordinance of the lord how do ye say we are wise and the law of the lord is with us lo certainly in vain hath wrought the vain pen of the scribes the wise men are ashamed they are dismayed and taken lo they have rejected the word of the lord and what wisdom is in them therefore will i give their wives unto others and their fields to them that shall possess them for from the least even unto the greatest every one is greedy for gain from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely and they have healed the hurt of the daughter of my people lightly saying peace peace when there is no peace they shall be put to shame because they have committed abomination yea they are not at all ashamed neither know they how to blush therefore shall they fall among them that fall in the time of their visitation they shall stumble saith the lord  i will utterly consume them saith the lord there are no grapes on the vine nor figs on the figtree and the leaf is faded and i gave them that which they transgress why do we sit still assemble yourselves and let us enter into the fortified citi',\n",
       "  'es and let us be cut off there for the lord our god hath cut us off and given us water of gall to drink because we have sinned against the lord we looked for peace but no good came and for a time of healing and behold terror the snorting of his horses is heard from dan at the sound of the neighing of his strong ones the whole land trembleth for they are come and have devoured the land and all that is in it the city and those that dwell therein  for behold i will send serpents basilisks among you which will not be charmed and they shall bite you saith the lord s though i would take comfort against sorrow my heart is faint within me behold the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people from a land far off is not the lord in zion is not her king in herwhy have they provoked me with their graven images and with strange vanities the harvest is past the summer is ended and we are not saved for the hurt of the daughter of my people am i seized with anguish i am black appalment hath taken hold on me is there no balm in gilead is there no physician there why then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered s oh that my head were waters and mine eyes a fountain of tears that i might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people s oh that i were in the wilderness in a lodgingplace of wayfaring men that i might leave my people and go from them for they are all adulterers an assembly of treacherous men and they bend their tongue their bow of falsehood and they are grown mighty in the land but not for truth for they proceed from evil to evil and me they know not saith the lord take ye heed every one of his neighbour and trust ye not in any brother for every brother acteth subtly and every neighbour goeth about with slanders and they deceive every one his neighbour and truth they speak not they have taught their tongue to speak lies they weary themselves to commit iniquity thy habitation is in the midst of deceit through deceit they refuse to know me saith the lord s therefore thus saith the lord of hosts behold i will smelt them and try them for how else should i do because of the daughter of my people their tongue is a sharpened arrow it speaketh deceit one speaketh peaceably to his neighbour with his mouth but in his heart he layeth wait for him shall i not punish them for these things saith the lord shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this s for the mountains will i take up a weeping and wailing and for the pastures of the wilderness a lamentation because they are burned up so that none passeth through and they hear not the voice of the cattle both the fowl of the heavens and the beast are fled and gone and i will make jerusalem heaps a lair of jackals and i will make the cities of judah a desolation without an inhabitant s who is the wise man that he may understand this and who is he to whom the mouth of the lord hath spoken that he may declare it wherefore is the land perished and laid waste like a wilderness so that none passeth through s and the lord saith because they have forsaken my law which i set before them and have not hearkened to my voice neither walked therein but have walked after the stubbornness of their own heart and after the baalim which their fathers taught them  therefore thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel behold i will feed them even this people with wormwood and give them water of gall to drink i will scatter them also among the nations whom neither they nor their fathers have known and i will send the sword after them till i have consumed them  thus saith the lord of hosts consider ye and call for the mourning women that they may come and send for the wise women that they may come and let them make haste and take up a wailing for us that our eyes may run down with tears and our eyelids gush out with waters for a voice of wailing is heard out of zion how are we undone we are greatly confounded because we have forsaken the land because our dwellings have cast us out s yea hear the word of the lord o ye women and let your ear receive the word of his mouth and teach your daughters wailing and every one her neighbour lamentation for death is come up into our windows it is entered into our palaces to cut off the children from the street and the young men from the broad places speak thus saith the lordand the carcasses of men fall as dung upon the open field and as the handful after the harvestman which none gathereth s thus saith the lord let not the wise man glory in his wisdom neither let the mighty man glory in his might let not the rich man glory in his riches but let him that glorieth glory in this that he understandeth and knoweth me that i am the lord who exercise mercy justice and righteousness in the earth for in these things i delight saith the lord s behold the days come saith the lord that i will punish all them that are circumcised in their uncircumcision egypt and judah and edom and the children of ammon and moab and all that have the corners of their hair polled that dwell in the wilderness for all the nations are uncircumcised but all the house of israel are uncircumcised in the heart  hear ye the word which the lord speaketh unto you o house of israel thus saith the lord learn not the way of the nations and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven for the nations are dismayed at them for the customs of the peoples are vanity for it is but a tree which one cutteth out of the forest the work of the hands of the workman with the axe they deck it with silver and with gold they fasten it with nails and with hammers that it move not they are like a pillar in a garden of cucumbers and speak not they must needs be borne because they cannot go be not afraid of them for they cannot do evil neither is it in them to do good  there is none like unto thee o lord thou art great and thy name is great in might who would not fear thee o king of the nations for it befitteth thee forasmuch as among all the wise men of the nations and in all their royalty there is none like unto thee but they are altogether brutish and foolish the vanities by which they are instructed are but a stock silver beaten into plates which is brought from tarshish and gold from uphaz the work of the craftsman and of the hands of the goldsmith blue and purple is their clothing they are all the work of skilful men but the lord god is the true god he is the living god and the everlasting king at his wrath the earth trembleth and the nations are not able to abide his indignation  thus shall ye say unto them the gods that have not made the heavens and the earth these shall perish from the earth and from under the heavens s he that hath made the earth by his power that hath established the world by his wisdom and hath stretched out the heavens by his understanding at the sound of his giving a multitude of waters in the heavens when he causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth when he maketh lightnings with the rain and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasuries every man is proved to be brutish without knowledge every goldsmith is put to shame by the graven image his molten image is falsehood and there is no breath in them they are vanity a work of delusion in the time of their visitation they shall perish not like these is the portion of jacob for he is the former of all things and israel is the tribe of his inheritance the lord of hosts is his name s gather up thy wares from the ground o thou that abidest in the siege s for thus saith the lord behold i will sling out the inhabitants of the land at this time and will distress them that they may feel it s woe is me for my hurt my wound is grievous but i said this is but a sickness and i must bear it my tent is spoiled and all my cords are broken my children are gone forth of me and they are not there is none to stretch forth my tent any more and to set up my curtains for the shepherds are become brutish and have not inquired of the lord therefore they have not prospered and all their flocks are scattered  hark a report behold it cometh and a great commotion out of the north country to make the cities of judah desolate a dwellingplace of jackals s o lord i know that mans way is not his own it is not in man to direct his steps as he walketh o lord correct me but in measure not in thine anger lest thou diminish me pour out thy wrath upon the nations that know thee not and upon the families that call not on thy name for they have devoured jacob yea they have devoured him and consumed him and have laid waste his habitation  the word that came to jeremiah from the lord saying hear ye the words of this covenant and speak unto the men of judah and to the inhabitants of jerusalem and say thou unto them thus saith the lord the god of israel cursed be the man that heareth not the words of this covenant which i commanded your fathers in the day that i brought them forth out of the land of egypt out of the iron furnace saying hearken to my voice and do them according to all which i command you so shall ye be my people and i will be your god that i may establish the oath which i swore unto your fathers to give them a land flowing with milk and honey as at this day then answered i and said amen o lord  and the lord said unto me proclaim all these words in the cities of judah and in the streets of jerusalem saying hear ye the words of this covenant and do them for i earnestly forewarned your fathers in the day that i brought them up out of the land of egypt even unto this day forewarning betimes and often saying hearken to my voice yet they hearkened not nor inclined their ear but walked every one in the stubbornness of their evil heart therefore i brought upon them all the words of this covenant which i commanded them to do but they did them not s and the lord said unto me a conspiracy is found among the men of judah and among the inhabitants of jerusalem they are turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers who refused to hear my words and they are gone after other gods to serve them the house of israel and the house of judah have broken my covenant which i made with their fathers s therefore thus saith the lord behold i will bring evil upon them which they shall not be able to escape and though they shall cry unto me i will not hearken unto them then shall the cities of judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem go and cry unto the gods unto whom they offer but they shall not save them at all in the time of their trouble for according to the number of thy cities are thy gods o judah and according to the number of the streets of jerusalem have ye set up altars to the shameful thing even altars to offer unto baal s therefore pray not thou for this people neither lift up cry nor prayer for them for i will not hear them in the time that they cry unto me for their trouble s what ha',\n",
       "  'th my beloved to do in my house seeing she hath wrought lewdness with many and the hallowed flesh is passed from thee when thou doest evil then thou rejoicest the lord called thy name a leafy olivetree fair with goodly fruit with the noise of a great tumult he hath kindled fire upon it and the branches of it are broken for the lord of hosts that planted thee hath pronounced evil against thee because of the evil of the house of israel and of the house of judah which they have wrought for themselves in provoking me by offering unto baal  and the lord gave me knowledge of it and i knew it then thou showedst me their doings but i was like a docile lamb that is led to the slaughter and i knew not that they had devised devices against me let us destroy the tree with the fruit thereof and let us cut him off from the land of the living that his name may be no more remembered but o lord of hosts that judgest righteously that triest the reins and the heart let me see thy vengeance on them for unto thee have i revealed my cause s therefore thus saith the lord concerning the men of anathoth that seek thy life saying thou shalt not prophesy in the name of the lord that thou die not by our hand  therefore thus saith the lord of hosts behold i will punish them the young men shall die by the sword their sons and their daughters shall die by famine and there shall be no remnant unto them for i will bring evil upon the men of anathoth even the year of their visitation s right wouldest thou be o lord were i to contend with thee yet will i reason with thee wherefore doth the way of the wicked prosper wherefore are all they secure that deal very treacherously thou hast planted them yea they have taken root they grow yea they bring forth fruit thou art near in their mouth and far from their reins but thou o lord knowest me thou seest me and triest my heart toward thee pull them out like sheep for the slaughter and prepare them for the day of slaughter  how long shall the land mourn and the herbs of the whole field wither for the wickedness of them that dwell therein the beasts are consumed and the birds because they said he seeth not our end if thou hast run with the footmen and they have wearied thee then how canst thou contend with horses and though in a land of peace thou art secure yet how wilt thou do in the thickets of the jordan for even thy brethren and the house of thy father even they have dealt treacherously with thee even they have cried aloud after thee believe them not though they speak fair words unto thee s i have forsaken my house i have cast off my heritage i have given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies my heritage is become unto me as a lion in the forest she hath uttered her voice against me therefore have i hated her is my heritage unto me as a speckled bird of prey are the birds of prey against her round about come ye assemble all the beasts of the field bring them to devour many shepherds have destroyed my vineyard they have trodden my portion under foot they have made my pleasant portion a desolate wilderness they have made it a desolation it mourneth unto me being desolate the whole land is made desolate because no man layeth it to heart upon all the high hills in the wilderness spoilers are come for the sword of the lord devoureth from the one end of the land even to the other end of the land no flesh hath peace s they have sown wheat and have reaped thorns they have put themselves to pain they profit not be ye then ashamed of your increase because of the fierce anger of the lord  thus saith the lord as for all mine evil neighbours that touch the inheritance which i have caused my people israel to inherit behold i will pluck them up from off their land and will pluck up the house of judah from among them and it shall come to pass after that i have plucked them up i will again have compassion on them and i will bring them back every man to his heritage and every man to his land and it shall come to pass if they will diligently learn the ways of my people to swear by my name as the lord liveth even as they taught my people to swear by baal then shall they be built up in the midst of my people but if they will not hearken then will i pluck up that nation plucking up and destroying it saith the lord s thus said the lord unto me go and get thee a linen girdle and put it upon thy loins and put it not in water so i got a girdle according to the word of the lord and put it upon my loins  and the word of the lord came unto me the second time saying take the girdle that thou hast gotten which is upon thy loins and arise go to perath and hide it there in a cleft of the rock so i went and hid it in perath as the lord commanded me and it came to pass after many days that the lord said unto me arise go to perath and take the girdle from thence which i commanded thee to hide there then i went to perath and digged and took the girdle from the place where i had hid it and behold the girdle was marred it was profitable for nothing  then the word of the lord came unto me saying thus saith the lord after this manner will i mar the pride of judah and the great pride of jerusalem even this evil people that refuse to hear my words that walk in the stubbornness of their heart and are gone after other gods to serve them and to worship them that it be as this girdle which is profitable for nothing s for as the girdle cleaveth to the loins of a man so have i caused to cleave unto me the whole house of israel and the whole house of judah saith the lord that they might be unto me for a people and for a name and for a praise and for a glory but they would not hearken moreover thou shalt speak unto them this word s thus saith the lord the god of israel every bottle is filled with wine and when they shall say unto thee do we not know that every bottle is filled with wine then shalt thou say unto them thus saith the lord behold i will fill all the inhabitants of this land even the kings that sit upon davids throne and the priests and the prophets and all the inhabitants of jerusalem with drunkenness and i will dash them one against another even the fathers and the sons together saith the lord i will not pity nor spare nor have compassion that i should not destroy them hear ye and give ear be not proud for the lord hath spoken give glory to the lord your god before it grow dark and before your feet stumble upon the mountains of twilight and while ye look for light he turn it into the shadow of death and make it gross darkness but if ye will not hear it my soul shall weep in secret for your pride and mine eyes shall weep sore and run down with tears because the lords flock is carried away captive s say thou unto the king and to the queenmother sit ye down low for your headtires are come down even your beautiful crown the cities of the south are shut up and there is none to open them judah is carried away captive all of it it is wholly carried away captive s lift up your eyes and behold them that come from the north where is the flock that was given thee thy beautiful flock what wilt thou say when he shall set the friends over thee as head whom thou thyself hast trained against thee shall not pangs take hold of thee as of a woman in travail and if thou say in thy heart wherefore are these things befallen mefor the greatness of thine iniquity are thy skirts uncovered and thy heels suffer violence can the ethiopian change his skin or the leopard his spots then may ye also do good that are accustomed to do evil therefore will i scatter them as the stubble that passeth away by the wind of the wilderness this is thy lot the portion measured unto thee from me saith the lord because thou hast forgotten me and trusted in falsehood therefore will i also uncover thy skirts upon thy face and thy shame shall appear thine adulteries and thy neighings the lewdness of thy harlotry on the hills in the field have i seen thy detestable acts woe unto thee o jerusalem thou wilt not be made clean when shall it ever be s the word of the lord that came to jeremiah concerning the droughts judah mourneth and the gates thereof languish they bow down in black unto the ground and the cry of jerusalem is gone up and their nobles send their lads for water they come to the pits and find no water their vessels return empty they are ashamed and confounded and cover their heads because of the ground which is cracked for there hath been no rain in the land the plowmen are ashamed they cover their heads yea the hind also in the field calveth and forsaketh her young because there is no grass and the wild asses stand on the high hills they gasp for air like jackals their eyes fail because there is no herbage though our iniquities testify against us o lord work thou for thy names sake for our backslidings are many we have sinned against thee o thou hope of israel the saviour thereof in time of trouble why shouldest thou be as a stranger in the land and as a wayfaring man that turneth aside to tarry for a night why shouldest thou be as a man overcome as a mighty man that cannot save yet thou o lord art in the midst of us and thy name is called upon us leave us not s thus saith the lord unto this people even so have they loved to wander they have not refrained their feet therefore the lord doth not accept them now will he remember their iniquity and punish their sins  and the lord said unto me pray not for this people for their good when they fast i will not hear their cry and when they offer burntoffering and mealoffering i will not accept them but i will consume them by the sword and by the famine and by the pestilence s then said i ah lord god behold the prophets say unto them ye shall not see the sword neither shall ye have famine but i will give you assured peace in this place s then the lord said unto me the prophets prophesy lies in my name i sent them not neither have i commanded them neither spoke i unto them they prophesy unto you a lying vision and divination and a thing of nought and the deceit of their own heart s therefore thus saith the lord as for the prophets that prophesy in my name and i sent them not yet they say sword and famine shall not be in this land by sword and famine shall those prophets be consumed and the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of jerusalem because of the famine and the sword and they shall have none to bury them them their wives nor their sons nor their daughters for i will pour their evil upon them and thou shalt say this word unto them let mine eyes run down with tears night and day and let them not cease for the virgin daughter of my people is broken with a great breach with a very grievous blow if i go forth into the field then behold the slain with the sword and if i enter into the city then behold them that are sick with famine for b',\n",
       "  'oth the prophet and the priest are gone about to a land and knew it not s hast thou utterly rejected judah hath thy soul loathed zion why hast thou smitten us and there is no healing for us we looked for peace but no good came and for a time of healing and behold terror we acknowledge o lord our wickedness even the iniquity of our fathers for we have sinned against thee do not contemn us for thy names sake do not dishonour the throne of thy glory remember break not thy covenant with us are there any among the vanities of the nations that can cause rain or can the heavens give showers art not thou he o lord our god and do we not wait for thee for thou hast made all these things  then said the lord unto me though moses and samuel stood before me yet my mind could not be toward this people cast them out of my sight and let them go forth and it shall come to pass when they say unto thee whither shall we go forth then thou shall tell them thus saith the lord such as are for death to death and such as are for the sword to the sword and such as are for the famine to the famine and such as are for captivity to captivity and i will appoint over them four kinds saith the lord the sword to slay and the dogs to drag and the fowls of the heaven and the beasts of the earth to devour and to destroy and i will cause them to be a horror among all the kingdoms of the earth because of manasseh the son of hezekiah king of judah for that which he did in jerusalem for who shall have pity upon thee o jerusalem or who shall bemoan thee or who shall turn aside to ask of thy welfare thou hast cast me off saith the lord thou art gone backward therefore do i stretch out my hand against thee and destroy thee i am weary with repenting and i fan them with a fan in the gates of the land i bereave them of children i destroy my people since they return not from their ways their widows are increased to me above the sand of the seas i bring upon them against the mother a chosen one even a spoiler at noonday i cause anguish and terrors to fall upon her suddenly she that hath borne seven languisheth her spirit droopeth her sun is gone down while it was yet day she is ashamed and confounded and the residue of them will i deliver to the sword before their enemies saith the lord s woe is me my mother that thou hast borne me a man of strife and a man of contention to the whole earth i have not lent neither have men lent to me yet every one of them doth curse me s the lord said verily i will release thee for good verily i will cause the enemy to make supplication unto thee in the time of evil and in the time of affliction can iron break iron from the north and brass thy substance and thy treasures will i give for a spoil without price and that for all thy sins even in all thy borders and i will make thee to pass with thine enemies into a land which thou knowest not for a fire is kindled in my nostril which shall burn upon you s thou o lord knowest remember me and think of me and avenge me of my persecutors take me not away because of thy longsuffering know that for thy sake i have suffered taunts thy words were found and i did eat them and thy words were unto me a joy and the rejoicing of my heart because thy name was called on me o lord god of hosts s i sat not in the assembly of them that make merry nor rejoiced i sat alone because of thy hand for thou hast filled me with indignation why is my pain perpetual and my wound incurable so that it refuseth to be healed wilt thou indeed be unto me as a deceitful brook as waters that fail s therefore thus saith the lord if thou return and i bring thee back thou shalt stand before me and if thou bring forth the precious out of the vile thou shalt be as my mouth let them return unto thee but thou shalt not return unto them and i will make thee unto this people a fortified brazen wall and they shall fight against thee but they shall not prevail against thee for i am with thee to save thee and to deliver thee saith the lord and i will deliver thee out of the hand of the wicked and i will redeem thee out of the hand of the terrible s the word of the lord came also unto me saying thou shalt not take thee a wife neither shalt thou have sons or daughters in this place s for thus saith the lord concerning the sons and concerning the daughters that are born in this place and concerning their mothers that bore them and concerning their fathers that begot them in this land they shall die of grievous deaths they shall not be lamented neither shall they be buried they shall be as dung upon the face of the ground and they shall be consumed by the sword and by famine and their carcasses shall be meat for the fowls of heaven and for the beasts of the earth s for thus saith the lord enter not into the house of mourning neither go to lament neither bemoan them for i have taken away my peace from this people saith the lord even mercy and compassion both the great and the small shall die in this land they shall not be buried neither shall men lament for them nor cut themselves nor make themselves bald for them neither shall men break bread for them in mourning to comfort them for the dead neither shall men give them the cup of consolation to drink for their father or for their mother and thou shalt not go into the house of feasting to sit with them to eat and to drink  for thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel behold i will cause to cease out of this place before your eyes and in your days the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride and it shall come to pass when thou shalt tell this people all these words and they shall say unto thee wherefore hath the lord pronounced all this great evil against us or what is our iniquity or what is our sin that we have committed against the lord our god then shalt thou say unto them because your fathers have forsaken me saith the lord and have walked after other gods and have served them and have worshipped them and have forsaken me and have not kept my law and ye have done worse than your fathers for behold ye walk every one after the stubbornness of his evil heart so that ye hearken not unto me therefore will i cast you out of this land into a land that ye have not known neither ye nor your fathers and there shall ye serve other gods day and night forasmuch as i will show you no favour  therefore behold the days come saith the lord that it shall no more be said as the lord liveth that brought up the children of israel out of the land of egypt but as the lord liveth that brought up the children of israel from the land of the north and from all the countries whither he had driven them and i will bring them back into their land that i gave unto their fathers  behold i will send for many fishers saith the lord and they shall fish them and afterward i will send for many hunters and they shall hunt them from every mountain and from every hill and out of the clefts of the rocks for mine eyes are upon all their ways they are not hid from my face neither is their iniquity concealed from mine eyes and first i will recompense their iniquity and their sin double because they have profaned my land they have filled mine inheritance with the carcasses of their detestable things and their abominations  o lord my strength and my stronghold and my refuge in the day of affliction unto thee shall the nations come from the ends of the earth and shall say our fathers have inherited nought but lies vanity and things wherein there is no profit shall a man make unto himself gods and they are no gods therefore behold i will cause them to know this once will i cause them to know my hand and my might and they shall know that my name is the lord s the sin of judah is written with a pen of iron and with the point of a diamond it is graven upon the tablet of their heart and upon the horns of your altars like the symbols of their sons are their altars and their asherim are by the leafy trees upon the high hills o thou that sittest upon the mountain in the field i will give thy substance and all thy treasures for a spoil and thy high places because of sin throughout all thy borders and thou even of thyself shalt discontinue from thy heritage that i gave thee and i will cause thee to serve thine enemies in the land which thou knowest not for ye have kindled a fire in my nostril which shall burn for ever s thus saith the lord cursed is the man that trusteth in man and maketh flesh his arm and whose heart departeth from the lord for he shall be like a tamarisk in the desert and shall not see when good cometh but shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness a salt land and not inhabited s blessed is the man that trusteth in the lord and whose trust the lord is for he shall be as a tree planted by the waters and that spreadeth out its roots by the river and shall not see when heat cometh but its foliage shall be luxuriant and shall not be anxious in the year of drought neither shall cease from yielding fruit the heart is deceitful above all things and it is exceeding weakwho can know it i the lord search the heart i try the reins even to give every man according to his ways according to the fruit of his doings s as the partridge that broodeth over young which she hath not brought forth so is he that getteth riches and not by right in the midst of his days he shall leave them and at his end he shall be a fool thou throne of glory on high from the beginning thou place of our sanctuary thou hope of israel the lord all that forsake thee shall be ashamed they that depart from thee shall be written in the earth because they have forsaken the lord the fountain of living waters  heal me o lord and i shall be healed save me and i shall be saved for thou art my praise behold they say unto me where is the word of the lord let it come now as for me i have not hastened from being a shepherd after thee neither have i desired the woeful day thou knowest it that which came out of my lips was manifest before thee be not a ruin unto me thou art my refuge in the day of evil let them be ashamed that persecute me but let not me be ashamed let them be dismayed but let not me be dismayed bring upon them the day of evil and destroy them with double destruction s thus said the lord unto me go and stand in the gate of the children of the people whereby the kings of judah come in and by which they go out and in all the gates of jerusalem and say unto them hear ye the word of the lord ye kings of judah and all judah and all the inhabitants of jerusalem that enter in by these gates thus saith the lord take heed for the sake of your souls and bear no burden on the sabbath day nor bring it in by the gates of jerusalem neither carry forth a burden out of your houses on the sabbath day neither do ye any work but hallow ye the sabbath day as i',\n",
       "  ' commanded your fathers but they hearkened not neither inclined their ear but made their neck stiff that they might not hear nor receive instruction and it shall come to pass if ye diligently hearken unto me saith the lord to bring in no burden through the gates of this city on the sabbath day but to hallow the sabbath day to do no work therein then shall there enter in by the gates of this city kings and princes sitting upon the throne of david riding in chariots and on horses they and their princes the men of judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem and this city shall be inhabited for ever and they shall come from the cities of judah and from the places round about jerusalem and from the land of benjamin and from the lowland and from the mountains and from the south bringing burntofferings and sacrifices and mealofferings and frankincense and bringing sacrifices of thanksgiving unto the house of the lord but if ye will not hearken unto me to hallow the sabbath day and not to bear a burden and enter in at the gates of jerusalem on the sabbath day then will i kindle a fire in the gates thereof and it shall devour the palaces of jerusalem and it shall not be quenched  the word which came to jeremiah from the lord saying arise and go down to the potters house and there i will cause thee to hear my words then i went down to the potters house and behold he was at his work on the wheels and whensoever the vessel that he made of the clay was marred in the hand of the potter he made it again another vessel as seemed good to the potter to make it s then the word of the lord came to me saying o house of israel cannot i do with you as this potter saith the lord behold as the clay in the potters hand so are ye in my hand o house of israel s at one instant i may speak concerning a nation and concerning a kingdom to pluck up and to break down and to destroy it but if that nation turn from their evil because of which i have spoken against it i repent of the evil that i thought to do unto it s and at one instant i may speak concerning a nation and concerning a kingdom to build and to plant it but if it do evil in my sight that it hearken not to my voice then i repent of the good wherewith i said i would benefit it s now therefore do thou speak to the men of judah and to the inhabitants of jerusalem saying thus saith the lord behold i frame evil against you and devise a device against you return ye now every one from his evil way and amend your ways and your doings but they say there is no hope but we will walk after our own devices and we will do every one after the stubbornness of his evil heart  therefore thus saith the lord ask ye now among the nations who hath heard such things the virgin of israel hath done a very horrible thing doth the snow of lebanon fail from the rock of the field or are the strange cold flowing waters plucked up for my people hath forgotten me they offer unto vanity and they have been made to stumble in their ways in the ancient paths to walk in bypaths in a way not cast up to make their land an astonishment and a perpetual hissing every one that passeth thereby shall be astonished and shake his head i will scatter them as with an east wind before the enemy i will look upon their back and not their face in the day of their calamity s then said they come and let us devise devices against jeremiah for instruction shall not perish from the priest nor counsel from the wise nor the word from the prophet come and let us smite him with the tongue and let us not give heed to any of his words give heed to me o lord and hearken to the voice of them that contend with me shall evil be recompensed for good for they have digged a pit for my soul remember how i stood before thee to speak good for them to turn away thy wrath from them therefore deliver up their children to the famine and hurl them to the power of the sword and let their wives be bereaved of their children and widows and let their men be slain of death and their young men smitten of the sword in battle let a cry be heard from their houses when thou shalt bring a troop suddenly upon them for they have digged a pit to take me and hid snares for my feet yet lord thou knowest all their counsel against me to slay me forgive not their iniquity neither blot out their sin from thy sight but let them be made to stumble before thee deal thou with them in the time of thine anger s thus said the lord go and get a potters earthen bottle and take of the elders of the people and of the elders of the priests and go forth unto the valley of the son of hinnom which is by the entry of the gate harsith and proclaim there the words that i shall tell thee and say hear ye the word of the lord o kings of judah and inhabitants of jerusalem thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel behold i will bring evil upon this place which whosoever heareth his ears shall tingle because they have forsaken me and have estranged this place and have offered in it unto other gods whom neither they nor their fathers have known nor the kings of judah and have filled this place with the blood of innocents and have built the high places of baal to burn their sons in the fire for burntofferings unto baal which i commanded not nor spoke it neither came it into my mind  therefore behold the days come saith the lord that this place shall no more be called topheth nor the valley of the son of hinnom but the valley of slaughter and i will make void the counsel of judah and jerusalem in this place and i will cause them to fall by the sword before their enemies and by the hand of them that seek their life and their carcasses will i give to be food for the fowls of the heaven and for the beasts of the earth and i will make this city an astonishment and a hissing every one that passeth thereby shall be astonished and hiss because of all the plagues thereof and i will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons and the flesh of their daughters and they shall eat every one the flesh of his friend in the siege and in the straitness wherewith their enemies and they that seek their life shall straiten them then shalt thou break the bottle in the sight of the men that go with thee and shalt say unto them thus saith the lord of hosts even so will i break this people and this city as one breaketh a potters vessel that cannot be made whole again and they shall bury in topheth for want of room to bury thus will i do unto this place saith the lord and to the inhabitants thereof even making this city as topheth and the houses of jerusalem and the houses of the kings of judah which are defiled shall be as the place of topheth even all the houses upon whose roofs they have offered unto all the host of heaven and have poured out drinkofferings unto other gods  then came jeremiah from topheth whither the lord had sent him to prophesy and he stood in the court of the lords house and said to all the people s thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel behold i will bring upon this city and upon all her towns all the evil that i have pronounced against it because they have made their neck stiff that they might not hear my words now pashhur the son of immer the priest who was chief officer in the house of the lord heard jeremiah prophesying these things then pashhur smote jeremiah the prophet and put him in the stocks that were in the upper gate of benjamin which was in the house of the lord and it came to pass on the morrow that pashhur brought forth jeremiah out of the stocks then said jeremiah unto him the lord hath not called thy name pashhur but magormissabib s for thus saith the lord behold i will make thee a terror to thyself and to all thy friends and they shall fall by the sword of their enemies and thine eyes shall behold it and i will give all judah into the hand of the king of babylon and he shall carry them captive to babylon and shall slay them with the sword moreover i will give all the store of this city and all the gains thereof and all the wealth thereof yea all the treasures of the kings of judah will i give into the hand of their enemies who shall spoil them and take them and carry them to babylon and thou pashhur and all that dwell in thy house shall go into captivity and thou shalt come to babylon and there thou shalt die and there shalt thou be buried thou and all thy friends to whom thou hast prophesied falsely  o lord thou hast enticed me and i was enticed thou hast overcome me and hast prevailed i am become a laughingstock all the day every one mocketh me for as often as i speak i cry out i cry violence and spoil because the word of the lord is made a reproach unto me and a derision all the day and if i say i will not make mention of him nor speak any more in his name then there is in my heart as it were a burning fire shut up in my bones and i weary myself to hold it in but cannot for i have heard the whispering of many terror on every side denounce and we will denounce him even of all my familiar friends them that watch for my halting peradventure he will be enticed and we shall prevail against him and we shall take our revenge on him but the lord is with me as a mighty warrior therefore my persecutors shall stumble and they shall not prevail they shall be greatly ashamed because they have not prospered even with an everlasting confusion which shall never be forgotten but o lord of hosts that triest the righteous that seest the reins and the heart let me see thy vengeance on them for unto thee have i revealed my cause s sing unto the lord praise ye the lord for he hath delivered the soul of the needy from the hand of evildoers s cursed be the day wherein i was born the day wherein my mother bore me let it not be blessed cursed be the man who brought tidings to my father saying a manchild is born unto thee making him very glad and let that man be as the cities which the lord overthrew and repented not and let him hear a cry in the morning and an alarm at noontide because he slew me not from the womb and so my mother would have been my grave and her womb always great wherefore came i forth out of the womb to see labour and sorrow that my days should be consumed in shame  the word which came unto jeremiah from the lord when king zedekiah sent unto him pashhur the son of malchiah and zephaniah the son of maaseiah the priest saying inquire i pray thee of the lord for us for nebuchadrezzar king of babylon maketh war against us peradventure the lord will deal with us according to all his wondrous works that he may go up from us then said jeremiah unto them thus shall ye say to zedekiah s thus saith the lord the god of israel behold i will turn back the weapons of war that are in your hands wherewith ye fight against the king of babylon and against the chaldeans that besiege you without the walls and i will gather them into the midst of this city an',\n",
       "  'd i myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and with a strong arm even in anger and in fury and in great wrath and i will smite the inhabitants of this city both man and beast they shall die of a great pestilence and afterward saith the lord i will deliver zedekiah king of judah and his servants and the people and such as are left in this city from the pestilence from the sword and from the famine into the hand of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon and into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of those that seek their life and he shall smite them with the edge of the sword he shall not spare them neither have pity nor have compassion and unto this people thou shalt say thus saith the lord behold i set before you the way of life and the way of death he that abideth in this city shall die by the sword and by the famine and by the pestilence but he that goeth out and falleth away to the chaldeans that besiege you he shall live and his life shall be unto him for a prey for i have set my face against this city for evil and not for good saith the lord it shall be given into the hand of the king of babylon and he shall burn it with fire s and unto the house of the king of judah hear ye the word of the lord o house of david thus saith the lord execute justice in the morning and deliver the spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor lest my fury go forth like fire and burn that none can quench it because of the evil of your doings behold i am against thee o inhabitant of the valley and rock of the plain saith the lord ye that say who shall come down against us or who shall enter into our habitations and i will punish you according to the fruit of your doings saith the lord and i will kindle a fire in her forest and it shall devour all that is round about her thus said the lord go down to the house of the king of judah and speak there this word and say hear the word of the lord o king of judah that sittest upon the throne of david thou and thy servants and thy people that enter in by these gates thus saith the lord execute ye justice and righteousness and deliver the spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor and do no wrong do no violence to the stranger the fatherless nor the widow neither shed innocent blood in this place for if ye do this thing indeed then shall there enter in by the gates of this house kings sitting upon the throne of david riding in chariots and on horses he and his servants and his people but if ye will not hear these words i swear by myself saith the lord that this house shall become a desolation  for thus saith the lord concerning the house of the king of judah thou art gilead unto me the head of lebanon yet surely i will make thee a wilderness cities which are not inhabited and i will prepare destroyers against thee every one with his weapons and they shall cut down thy choice cedars and cast them into the fire and many nations shall pass by this city and they shall say every man to his neighbour wherefore hath the lord done thus unto this great city then they shall answer because they forsook the covenant of the lord their god and worshipped other gods and served them s weep ye not for the dead neither bemoan him but weep sore for him that goeth away for he shall return no more nor see his native country for thus saith the lord touching shallum the son of josiah king of judah who reigned instead of josiah his father and who went forth out of this place he shall not return thither any more but in the place whither they have led him captive there shall he die and he shall see this land no more s woe unto him that buildeth his house by unrighteousness and his chambers by injustice that useth his neighbours service without wages and giveth him not his hire that saith i will build me a wide house and spacious chambers and cutteth him out windows and it is ceiled with cedar and painted with vermilion shalt thou reign because thou strivest to excel in cedar did not thy father eat and drink and do justice and righteousness then it was well with him he judged the cause of the poor and needy then it was well is not this to know me saith the lord but thine eyes and thy heart are not but for thy covetousness and for shedding innocent blood and for oppression and for violence to do it s therefore thus saith the lord concerning jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah they shall not lament for him ah my brother or ah sister they shall not lament for him ah lord or ah his glory he shall be buried with the burial of an ass drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of jerusalem s go up to lebanon and cry and lift up thy voice in bashan and cry from abarim for all thy lovers are destroyed i spoke unto thee in thy prosperity but thou saidst i will not hear this hath been thy manner from thy youth that thou hearkenedst not to my voice the wind shall feed upon all thy shepherds and thy lovers shall go into captivity surely then shalt thou be ashamed and confounded for all thy wickedness o inhabitant of lebanon that art nestled in the cedars how gracious shalt thou be when pangs come upon thee the pain as of a woman in travail as i live saith the lord though coniah the son of jehoiakim king of judah were the signet upon my right hand yet would i pluck thee thence and i will give thee into the hand of them that seek thy life and into the hand of them of whom thou art afraid even into the hand of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon and into the hand of the chaldeans and i will cast thee out and thy mother that bore thee into another country where ye were not born and there shall ye die but to the land whereunto they long to return thither shall they not return  is this man coniah a despised broken image is he a vessel wherein is no pleasure wherefore are they cast out he and his seed and are cast into the land which they know not o land land land hear the word of the lord thus saith the lord write ye this man childless a man that shall not prosper in his days for no man of his seed shall prosper sitting upon the throne of david and ruling any more in judah  woe unto the shepherds that destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture saith the lord s therefore thus saith the lord the god of israel against the shepherds that feed my people ye have scattered my flock and driven them away and have not taken care of them behold i will visit upon you the evil of your doings saith the lord and i will gather the remnant of my flock out of all the countries whither i have driven them and will bring them back to their folds and they shall be fruitful and multiply and i will set up shepherds over them who shall feed them and they shall fear no more nor be dismayed neither shall any be lacking saith the lord s behold the days come saith the lord that i will raise unto david a righteous shoot and he shall reign as king and prosper and shall execute justice and righteousness in the land in his days judah shall be saved and israel shall dwell safely and this is his name whereby he shall be called the lord is our righteousness  therefore behold the days come saith the lord that they shall no more say as the lord liveth that brought up the children of israel out of the land of egypt but as the lord liveth that brought up and that led the seed of the house of israel out of the north country and from all the countries whither i had driven them and they shall dwell in their own land  concerning the prophets my heart within me is broken all my bones shake i am like a drunken man and like a man whom wine hath overcome because of the lord and because of his holy words for the land is full of adulterers for because of swearing the land mourneth the pastures of the wilderness are dried up and their course is evil and their force is not right for both prophet and priest are ungodly yea in my house have i found their wickedness saith the lord wherefore their way shall be unto them as slippery places in the darkness they shall be thrust and fall therein for i will bring evil upon them even the year of their visitation saith the lord and i have seen unseemliness in the prophets of samaria they prophesied by baal and caused my people israel to err but in the prophets of jerusalem i have seen a horrible thing they commit adultery and walk in lies and they strengthen the hands of evildoers that none doth return from his wickedness they are all of them become unto me as sodom and the inhabitants thereof as gomorrah  therefore thus saith the lord of hosts concerning the prophets behold i will feed them with wormwood and make them drink the water of gall for from the prophets of jerusalem is ungodliness gone forth into all the land  thus saith the lord of hosts hearken not unto the words of the prophets that prophesy unto you they lead you unto vanity they speak a vision of their own heart and not out of the mouth of the lord they say continually unto them that despise me the lord hath said ye shall have peace and unto every one that walketh in the stubbornness of his own heart they say no evil shall come upon you for who hath stood in the council of the lord that he should perceive and hear his word who hath attended to his word and heard it s behold a storm of the lord is gone forth in fury yea a whirling storm it shall whirl upon the head of the wicked the anger of the lord shall not return until he have executed and till he have performed the purposes of his heart in the end of days ye shall consider it perfectly i have not sent these prophets yet they ran i have not spoken to them yet they prophesied but if they have stood in my council then let them cause my people to hear my words and turn them from their evil way and from the evil of their doings s am i a god near at hand saith the lord and not a god afar off can any hide himself in secret places that i shall not see him saith the lord do not i fill heaven and earth saith the lord i have heard what the prophets have said that prophesy lies in my name saying i have dreamed i have dreamed how long shall this be is it in the heart of the prophets that prophesy lies and the prophets of the deceit of their own heart that think to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams which they tell every man to his neighbour as their fathers forgot my name for baal the prophet that hath a dream let him tell a dream and he that hath my word let him speak my word faithfully what hath the straw to do with the wheat saith the lord is not my word like as fire saith the lord and like a hammer that breaketh the rock in pieces s therefore behold i am against the prophets saith the lord that steal my words every one from his neighbour behold i am against the prophets saith the lord that use their tongues and say he saith behold i am against them that prophesy lying dreams saith the lord and do tell them and cause my people to err by their lies and by their wa',\n",
       "  'ntonness yet i sent them not nor commanded them neither can they profit this people at all saith the lord and when this people or the prophet or a priest shall ask thee saying what is the burden of the lord then shalt thou say unto them what burden i will cast you off saith the lord and as for the prophet and the priest and the people that shall say the burden of the lord i will even punish that man and his house thus shall ye say every one to his neighbour and every one to his brother what hath the lord answered and what hath the lord spoken and the burden of the lord shall ye mention no more for every mans own word shall be his burden and would ye pervert the words of the living god of the lord of hosts our god thus shalt thou say to the prophet what hath the lord answered thee and what hath the lord spoken but if ye say the burden of the lord therefore thus saith the lord because ye say this word the burden of the lord and i have sent unto you saying ye shall not say the burden of the lord therefore behold i will utterly tear you out and i will cast you off and the city that i gave unto you and to your fathers away from my presence and i will bring an everlasting reproach upon you and a perpetual shame which shall not be forgotten  the lord showed me and behold two baskets of figs set before the temple of the lord after that nebuchadrezzar king of babylon had carried away captive jeconiah the son of jehoiakim king of judah and the princes of judah with the craftsmen and smiths from jerusalem and had brought them to babylon one basket had very good figs like the figs that are firstripe and the other basket had very bad figs which could not be eaten they were so bad  then said the lord unto me what seest thou jeremiah and i said figs the good figs very good and the bad very bad that cannot be eaten they are so bad  and the word of the lord came unto me saying thus saith the lord the god of israel like these good figs so will i regard the captives of judah whom i have sent out of this place into the land of the chaldeans for good and i will set mine eyes upon them for good and i will bring them back to this land and i will build them and not pull them down and i will plant them and not pluck them up and i will give them a heart to know me that i am the lord and they shall be my people and i will be their god for they shall return unto me with their whole heart s and as the bad figs which cannot be eaten they are so bad surely thus saith the lord so will i make zedekiah the king of judah and his princes and the residue of jerusalem that remain in this land and them that dwell in the land of egypt i will even make them a horror among all the kingdoms of the earth for evil a reproach and a proverb a taunt and a curse in all places whither i shall drive them and i will send the sword the famine and the pestilence among them till they be consumed from off the land that i gave unto them and to their fathers  the word that came to jeremiah concerning all the people of judah in the fourth year of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah that was the first year of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon which jeremiah the prophet spoke unto all the people of judah and to all the inhabitants of jerusalem saying from the thirteenth year of josiah the son of amon king of judah even unto this day these three and twenty years the word of the lord hath come unto me and i have spoken unto you speaking betimes and often but ye have not hearkened and the lord hath sent unto you all his servants the prophets sending them betimes and oftenbut ye have not hearkened nor inclined your ear to hear saying return ye now every one from his evil way and from the evil of your doings and dwell in the land that the lord hath given unto you and to your fathers for ever and ever and go not after other gods to serve them and to worship them and provoke me not with the work of your hands and i will do you no hurt yet ye have not hearkened unto me saith the lord that ye might provoke me with the work of your hands to your own hurt  therefore thus saith the lord of hosts because ye have not heard my words behold i will send and take all the families of the north saith the lord and i will send unto nebuchadrezzar the king of babylon my servant and will bring them against this land and against the inhabitants thereof and against all these nations round about and i will utterly destroy them and make them an astonishment and a hissing and perpetual desolations moreover i will cause to cease from among them the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride the sound of the millstones and the light of the lamp and this whole land shall be a desolation and a waste and these nations shall serve the king of babylon seventy years and it shall come to pass when seventy years are accomplished that i will punish the king of babylon and that nation saith the lord for their iniquity and the land of the chaldeans and i will make it perpetual desolations and i will bring upon that land all my words which i have pronounced against it even all that is written in this book which jeremiah hath prophesied against all the nations for many nations and great kings shall make bondmen of them also and i will recompense them according to their deeds and according to the work of their own hands  for thus saith the lord the god of israel unto me take this cup of the wine of fury at my hand and cause all the nations to whom i send thee to drink it and they shall drink and reel to and fro and be like madmen because of the sword that i will send among them then took i the cup of the lords hand and made all the nations to drink unto whom the lord had sent me jerusalem and the cities of judah and the kings thereof and the princes thereof to make them an appalment an astonishment a hissing and a curse as it is this day pharaoh king of egypt and his servants and his princes and all his people and all the mingled people and all the kings of the land of uz and all the kings of the land of the philistines and ashkelon and gaza and ekron and the remnant of ashdod edom and moab and the children of ammon and all the kings of tyre and all the kings of zidon and the kings of the isle which is beyond the sea dedan and tema and buz and all that have the corners of their hair polled and all the kings of arabia and all the kings of the mingled people that dwell in the wilderness and all the kings of zimri and all the kings of elam and all the kings of the medes and all the kings of the north far and near one with another and all the kingdoms of the world which are upon the face of the earthand the king of sheshach shall drink after them and thou shalt say unto them p\\xa0thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel drink ye and be drunken and spew and fall and rise no more because of the sword which i will send among you and it shall be if they refuse to take the cup at thy hand to drink then shalt thou say unto them thus saith the lord of hosts ye shall surely drink for lo i begin to bring evil on the city whereupon my name is called and should ye be utterly unpunished ye shall not be unpunished for i will call for a sword upon all the inhabitants of the earth saith the lord of hosts therefore prophesy thou against them all these words and say unto them the lord doth roar from on high and utter his voice from his holy habitation he doth mightily roar because of his fold he giveth a shout as they that tread the grapes against all the inhabitants of the earth a noise is come even to the end of the earth for the lord hath a controversy with the nations he doth plead with all flesh as for the wicked he hath given them to the sword saith the lord s thus saith the lord of hosts behold evil shall go forth from nation to nation and a great storm shall be raised up from the uttermost parts of the earth and the slain of the lord shall be at that day from one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth they shall not be lamented neither gathered nor buried they shall be dung upon the face of the ground wail ye shepherds and cry and wallow yourselves in the dust ye leaders of the flock for the days of your slaughter are fully come and i will break you in pieces and ye shall fall like a precious vessel and the shepherds shall have no way to flee nor the leaders of the flock to escape hark the cry of the shepherds and the wailing of the leaders of the flock for the lord despoileth their pasture and the peaceable folds are brought to silence because of the fierce anger of the lord he hath forsaken his covert as the lion for their land is become a waste because of the fierceness of the oppressing sword and because of his fierce anger  in the beginning of the reign of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah came this word from the lord saying thus saith the lord stand in the court of the lords house and speak unto all the cities of judah which come to worship in the lords house all the words that i command thee to speak unto them diminish not a word it may be they will hearken and turn every man from his evil way that i may repent me of the evil which i purpose to do unto them because of the evil of their doings and thou shalt say unto them thus saith the lord if ye will not hearken to me to walk in my law which i have set before you to hearken to the words of my servants the prophets whom i send unto you even sending them betimes and often but ye have not hearkened then will i make this house like shiloh and will make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth  so the priests and the prophets and all the people heard jeremiah speaking these words in the house of the lord now it came to pass when jeremiah had made an end of speaking all that the lord had commanded him to speak unto all the people that the priests and the prophets and all the people laid hold on him saying thou shalt surely die why hast thou prophesied in the name of the lord saying this house shall be like shiloh and this city shall be desolate without an inhabitant and all the people were gathered against jeremiah in the house of the lord when the princes of judah heard these things they came up from the kings house unto the house of the lord and they sat in the entry of the new gate of the lords house s then spoke the priests and the prophets unto the princes and to all the people saying this man is worthy of death for he hath prophesied against this city as ye have heard with your ears then spoke jeremiah unto all the princes and to all the people saying the lord sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that ye have heard therefore now amend your ways and your doings and hearken to the voice of the lord your god and the lord will repent him of the evil that he hath pronounced against you but as for m',\n",
       "  'e behold i am in your hand do with me as is good and right in your eyes only know ye for certain that if ye put me to death ye will bring innocent blood upon yourselves and upon this city and upon the inhabitants thereof for of a truth the lord hath sent me unto you to speak all these words in your ears s then said the princes and all the people unto the priests and to the prophets this man is not worthy of death for he hath spoken to us in the name of the lord our god then rose up certain of the elders of the land and spoke to all the assembly of the people saying micah the morashtite prophesied in the days of hezekiah king of judah and he spoke to all the people of judah saying thus saith the lord of hosts zion shall be plowed as a field and jerusalem shall become heaps and the mountain of the house as the high places of a forest did hezekiah king of judah and all judah put him at all to death did he not fear the lord and entreat the favour of the lord and the lord repented him of the evil which he had pronounced against them thus might we procure great evil against our own souls and there was also a man that prophesied in the name of the lord uriah the son of shemaiah of kiriathjearim and he prophesied against this city and against this land according to all the words of jeremiah and when jehoiakim the king with all his mighty men and all the princes heard his words the king sought to put him to death but when uriah heard it he was afraid and fled and went into egypt and jehoiakim the king sent men into egypt elnathan the son of achbor and certain men with him into egypt and they fetched forth uriah out of egypt and brought him unto jehoiakim the king who slew him with the sword and cast his dead body into the graves of the children of the people nevertheless the hand of ahikam the son of shaphan was with jeremiah that they should not give him into the hand of the people to put him to death  in the beginning of the reign of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah came this word unto jeremiah from the lord saying thus saith the lord to me make thee bands and bars and put them upon thy neck and send them to the king of edom and to the king of moab and to the king of the children of ammon and to the king of tyre and to the king of zidon by the hand of the messengers that come to jerusalem unto zedekiah king of judah and give them a charge unto their masters saying thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel thus shall ye say unto your masters i have made the earth the man and the beast that are upon the face of the earth by my great power and by my outstretched arm and i give it unto whom it seemeth right unto me and now have i given all these lands into the hand of nebuchadnezzar the king of babylon my servant and the beasts of the field also have i given him to serve him and all the nations shall serve him and his son and his sons son until the time of his own land come and then many nations and great kings shall make him their bondman and it shall come to pass that the nation and the kingdom which will not serve the same nebuchadnezzar king of babylon and that will not put their neck under the yoke of the king of babylon that nation will i visit saith the lord with the sword and with the famine and with the pestilence until i have consumed them by his hand but as for you hearken ye not to your prophets nor to your diviners nor to your dreams nor to your soothsayers nor to your sorcerers that speak unto you saying ye shall not serve the king of babylon for they prophesy a lie unto you to remove you far from your land and that i should drive you out and ye should perish but the nation that shall bring their neck under the yoke of the king of babylon and serve him that nation will i let remain in their own land saith the lord and they shall till it and dwell therein and i spoke to zedekiah king of judah according to all these words saying bring your necks under the yoke of the king of babylon and serve him and his people and live why will ye die thou and thy people by the sword by the famine and by the pestilence as the lord hath spoken concerning the nation that will not serve the king of babylon and hearken not unto the words of the prophets that speak unto you saying ye shall not serve the king of babylon for they prophesy a lie unto you for i have not sent them saith the lord and they prophesy falsely in my name that i might drive you out and that ye might perish ye and the prophets that prophesy unto you also i spoke to the priests and to all this people saying thus saith the lord hearken not to the words of your prophets that prophesy unto you saying behold the vessels of the lords house shall now shortly be brought back from babylon for they prophesy a lie unto you hearken not unto them serve the king of babylon and live wherefore should this city become desolate but if they be prophets and if the word of the lord be with them let them now make intercession to the lord of hosts that the vessels which are left in the house of the lord and in the house of the king of judah and at jerusalem go not to babylon for thus saith the lord of hosts concerning the pillars and concerning the sea and concerning the bases and concerning the residue of the vessels that remain in this city which nebuchadnezzar king of babylon took not when he carried away captive jeconiah the son of jehoiakim king of judah from jerusalem to babylon and all the nobles of judah and jerusalem yea thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel concerning the vessels that remain in the house of the lord and in the house of the king of judah and at jerusalem they shall be carried to babylon and there shall they be until the day that i remember them saith the lord and bring them up and restore them to this place  and it came to pass the same year in the beginning of the reign of zedekiah king of judah in the fourth year in the fifth month that hananiah the son of azzur the prophet who was of gibeon spoke unto me in the house of the lord in the presence of the priests and of all the people saying thus speaketh the lord of hosts the god of israel saying i have broken the yoke of the king of babylon within two full years will i bring back into this place all the vessels of the lords house that nebuchadnezzar king of babylon took away from this place and carried them to babylon and i will bring back to this place jeconiah the son of jehoiakim king of judah with all the captives of judah that went to babylon saith the lord for i will break the yoke of the king of babylon then the prophet jeremiah said unto the prophet hananiah in the presence of the priests and in the presence of all the people that stood in the house of the lord even the prophet jeremiah said amen the lord do so the lord perform thy words which thou hast prophesied to bring back the vessels of the lords house and all them that are carried away captive from babylon unto this place nevertheless hear thou now this word that i speak in thine ears and in the ears of all the people the prophets that have been before me and before thee of old prophesied against many countries and against great kingdoms of war and of evil and of pestilence the prophet that prophesieth of peace when the word of the prophet shall come to pass then shall the prophet be known that the lord hath truly sent him then hananiah the prophet took the bar from off the prophet jeremiahs neck and broke it and hananiah spoke in the presence of all the people saying thus saith the lord even so will i break the yoke of nebuchadnezzar king of babylon from off the neck of all the nations within two full years and the prophet jeremiah went his way  then the word of the lord came unto jeremiah after that hananiah the prophet had broken the bar from off the neck of the prophet jeremiah saying go and tell hananiah saying thus saith the lord thou hast broken the bars of wood but thou shalt make in their stead bars of iron for thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel i have put a yoke of iron upon the neck of all these nations that they may serve nebuchadnezzar king of babylon and they shall serve him and i have given him the beasts of the field also then said the prophet jeremiah unto hananiah the prophet hear now hananiah the lord hath not sent thee but thou makest this people to trust in a lie therefore thus saith the lord behold i will send thee away from off the face of the earth this year thou shalt die because thou hast spoken perversion against the lord so hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month  now these are the words of the letter that jeremiah the prophet sent from jerusalem unto the residue of the elders of the captivity and to the priests and to the prophets and to all the people whom nebuchadnezzar had carried away captive from jerusalem to babylon after that jeconiah the king and the queenmother and the officers and the princes of judah and jerusalem and the craftsmen and the smiths were departed from jerusalem by the hand of elasah the son of shaphan and gemariah the son of hilkiah whom zedekiah king of judah sent unto babylon to nebuchadnezzar king of babylon saying thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel unto all the captivity whom i have caused to be carried away captive from jerusalem unto babylon build ye houses and dwell in them and plant gardens and eat the fruit of them take ye wives and beget sons and daughters and take wives for your sons and give your daughters to husbands that they may bear sons and daughters and multiply ye there and be not diminished and seek the peace of the city whither i have caused you to be carried away captive and pray unto the lord for it for in the peace thereof shall ye have peace for thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel let not your prophets that are in the midst of you and your diviners beguile you neither hearken ye to your dreams which ye cause to be dreamed for they prophesy falsely unto you in my name i have not sent them saith the lord s for thus saith the lord after seventy years are accomplished for babylon i will remember you and perform my good word toward you in causing you to return to this place for i know the thoughts that i think toward you saith the lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you a future and a hope and ye shall call upon me and go and pray unto me and i will hearken unto you and ye shall seek me and find me when ye shall search for me with all your heart and i will be found of you saith the lord and i will turn your captivity and gather you from all the nations and from all the places whither i have driven you saith the lord and i will bring you back unto the place whence i caused you to be carried away captive for ye have said the lord hath raised us up prophets in babylon s for thus saith the lord concerning the king that sitteth upon th',\n",
       "  'e throne of david and concerning all the people that dwell in this city your brethren that are not gone forth with you into captivity thus saith the lord of hosts behold i will send upon them the sword the famine and the pestilence and will make them like vile figs that cannot be eaten they are so bad and i will pursue after them with the sword with the famine and with the pestilence and will make them a horror unto all the kingdoms of the earth a curse and an astonishment and a hissing and a reproach among all the nations whither i have driven them because they have not hearkened to my words saith the lord wherewith i sent unto them my servants the prophets sending them betimes and often but ye would not hear saith the lord hear ye therefore the word of the lord all ye of the captivity whom i have sent away from jerusalem to babylon s thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel concerning ahab the son of kolaiah and concerning zedekiah the son of maaseiah who prophesy a lie unto you in my name behold i will deliver them into the hand of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon and he shall slay them before your eyes and of them shall be taken up a curse by all the captivity of judah that are in babylon saying the lord make thee like zedekiah and like ahab whom the king of babylon roasted in the fire because they have wrought vile deeds in israel and have committed adultery with their neighbours wives and have spoken words in my name falsely which i commanded them not but i am he that knoweth and am witness saith the lord s and concerning shemaiah the nehelamite thou shalt speak saying thus speaketh the lord of hosts the god of israel saying because thou hast sent letters in thine own name unto all the people that are at jerusalem and to zephaniah the son of maaseiah the priest and to all the priests saying the lord hath made thee priest in the stead of jehoiada the priest that there should be officers in the house of the lord for every man that is mad and maketh himself a prophet that thou shouldest put him in the stocks and in the collar now therefore why hast thou not rebuked jeremiah of anathoth who maketh himself a prophet to you forasmuch as he hath sent unto us in babylon saying the captivity is long build ye houses and dwell in them and plant gardens and eat the fruit of them and zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of jeremiah the prophet  then came the word of the lord unto jeremiah saying send to all them of the captivity saying thus saith the lord concerning shemaiah the nehelamite because that shemaiah hath prophesied unto you and i sent him not and he hath caused you to trust in a lie therefore thus saith the lord behold i will punish shemaiah the nehelamite and his seed he shall not have a man to dwell among this people neither shall he behold the good that i will do unto my people saith the lord because he hath spoken perversion against the lord s the word that came to jeremiah from the lord saying thus speaketh the lord the god of israel saying write thee all the words that i have spoken unto thee in a book for lo the days come saith the lord that i will turn the captivity of my people israel and judah saith the lord and i will cause them to return to the land that i gave to their fathers and they shall possess it  and these are the words that the lord spoke concerning israel and concerning judah for thus saith the lord we have heard a voice of trembling of fear and not of peace ask ye now and see whether a man doth travail with child wherefore do i see every man with his hands on his loins as a woman in travail and all faces are turned into paleness alas for that day is great so that none is like it and it is a time of trouble unto jacob but out of it shall he be saved and it shall come to pass in that day saith the lord of hosts that i will break his yoke from off thy neck and will burst thy bands and strangers shall no more make him their bondman but they shall serve the lord their god and david their king whom i will raise up unto them s therefore fear thou not o jacob my servant saith the lord neither be dismayed o israel for lo i will save thee from afar and thy seed from the land of their captivity and jacob shall again be quiet and at ease and none shall make him afraid for i am with thee saith the lord to save thee for i will make a full end of all the nations whither i have scattered thee but i will not make a full end of thee for i will correct thee in measure and will not utterly destroy thee  for thus saith the lord thy hurt is incurable and thy wound is grievous none deemeth of thy wound that it may be bound up thou hast no healing medicines all thy lovers have forgotten thee they seek thee not for i have wounded thee with the wound of an enemy with the chastisement of a cruel one for the greatness of thine iniquity because thy sins were increased why criest thou for thy hurt that thy pain is incurable for the greatness of thine iniquity because thy sins were increased i have done these things unto thee therefore all they that devour thee shall be devoured and all thine adversaries every one of them shall go into captivity and they that spoil thee shall be a spoil and all that prey upon thee will i give for a prey for i will restore health unto thee and i will heal thee of thy wounds saith the lord because they have called thee an outcast she is zion there is none that careth for her s thus saith the lord behold i will turn the captivity of jacobs tents and have compassion on his dwellingplaces and the city shall be builded upon her own mound and the palace shall be inhabited upon its wonted place and out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of them that make merry and i will multiply them and they shall not be diminished i will also increase them and they shall not dwindle away their children also shall be as aforetime and their congregation shall be established before me and i will punish all that oppress them and their prince shall be of themselves and their ruler shall proceed from the midst of them and i will cause him to draw near and he shall approach unto me for who is he that hath pledged his heart to approach unto me saith the lord and ye shall be my people and i will be your god s behold a storm of the lord is gone forth in fury a sweeping storm it shall whirl upon the head of the wicked the fierce anger of the lord shall not return until he have executed and till he have performed the purposes of his heart in the end of days ye shall consider it at that time saith the lord will i be the god of all the families of israel and they shall be my people s thus saith the lord the people that were left of the sword have found grace in the wilderness even israel when i go to cause him to rest from afar the lord appeared unto me yea i have loved thee with an everlasting love therefore with affection have i drawn thee again will i build thee and thou shalt be built o virgin of israel again shalt thou be adorned with thy tabrets and shalt go forth in the dances of them that make merry again shalt thou plant vineyards upon the mountains of samaria the planters shall plant and shall have the use thereof for there shall be a day that the watchmen shall call upon the mount ephraim arise ye and let us go up to zion unto the lord our god  for thus saith the lord sing with gladness for jacob and shout at the head of the nations announce ye praise ye and say o lord save thy people the remnant of israel behold i will bring them from the north country and gather them from the uttermost parts of the earth and with them the blind and the lame the woman with child and her that travaileth with child together a great company shall they return hither they shall come with weeping and with supplications will i lead them i will cause them to walk by rivers of waters in a straight way wherein they shall not stumble for i am become a father to israel and ephraim is my firstborn s hear the word of the lord o ye nations and declare it in the isles afar off and say he that scattered israel doth gather him and keep him as a shepherd doth his flock for the lord hath ransomed jacob and he redeemeth him from the hand of him that is stronger than he and they shall come and sing in the height of zion and shall flow unto the goodness of the lord to the corn and to the wine and to the oil and to the young of the flock and of the herd and their soul shall be as a watered garden and they shall not pine any more at all then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance and the young men and the old together for i will turn their mourning into joy and will comfort them and make them rejoice from their sorrow and i will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness and my people shall be satisfied with my goodness saith the lord s thus saith the lord a voice is heard in ramah lamentation and bitter weeping rachel weeping for her children she refuseth to be comforted for her children because they are not s thus saith the lord refrain thy voice from weeping and thine eyes from tears for thy work shall be rewarded saith the lord and they shall come back from the land of the enemy and there is hope for thy future saith the lord and thy children shall return to their own border s i have surely heard ephraim bemoaning himself thou hast chastised me and i was chastised as a calf untrained turn thou me and i shall be turned for thou art the lord my god surely after that i was turned i repented and after that i was instructed i smote upon my thigh i was ashamed yea even confounded because i did bear the reproach of my youth is ephraim a darling son unto me is he a child that is dandled for as often as i speak of him i do earnestly remember him still therefore my heart yearneth for him i will surely have compassion upon him saith the lord s set thee up waymarks make thee guideposts set thy heart toward the highway even the way by which thou wentest return o virgin of israel return to these thy cities how long wilt thou turn away coyly o thou backsliding daughter for the lord hath created a new thing in the earth a woman shall court a man s thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel yet again shall they use this speech in the land of judah and in the cities thereof when i shall turn their captivity the lord bless thee o habitation of righteousness o mountain of holiness and judah and all the cities thereof shall dwell therein together the husbandmen and they that go forth with flocks for i have satiated the weary soul and every pining soul have i replenished upon this i awaked and beheld and my sleep was sweet unto me s behold the days come saith the lord that i will sow the house of israel and the house of judah with the seed of man and with the seed of beast and it shall come to pass that like as i have watched over them to pluck up and to break down and to overt',\n",
       "  'hrow and to destroy and to afflict so will i watch over them to build and to plant saith the lord in those days they shall say no more the fathers have eaten sour grapes and the childrens teeth are set on edge but every one shall die for his own iniquity every man that eateth the sour grapes his teeth shall be set on edge s behold the days come saith the lord that i will make a new covenant with the house of israel and with the house of judah not according to the covenant that i made with their fathers in the day that i took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of egypt forasmuch as they broke my covenant although i was a lord over them saith the lord but this is the covenant that i will make with the house of israel after those days saith the lord i will put my law in their inward parts and in their heart will i write it and i will be their god and they shall be my people and they shall teach no more every man his neighbour and every man his brother saying know the lord for they shall all know me from the least of them unto the greatest of them saith the lord for i will forgive their iniquity and their sin will i remember no more s thus saith the lord who giveth the sun for a light by day and the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night who stirreth up the sea that the waves thereof roar the lord of hosts is his name if these ordinances depart from before me saith the lord then the seed of israel also shall cease from being a nation before me for ever s thus saith the lord if heaven above can be measured and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath then will i also cast off all the seed of israel for all that they have done saith the lord s behold the days come saith the lord that the city shall be built to the lord from the tower of hananel unto the gate of the corner and the measuring line shall yet go out straight forward unto the hill gareb and shall turn about unto goah and the whole valley of the dead bodies and of the ashes and all the fields unto the brook kidron unto the corner of the horse gate toward the east shall be holy unto the lord it shall not be plucked up nor thrown down any more for ever  the word that came to jeremiah from the lord in the tenth year of zedekiah king of judah which was the eighteenth year of nebuchadrezzar now at that time the king of babylons army was besieging jerusalem and jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the guard which was in the king of judahs house for zedekiah king of judah had shut him up saying wherefore dost thou prophesy and say thus saith the lord behold i will give this city into the hand of the king of babylon and he shall take it and zedekiah king of judah shall not escape out of the hand of the chaldeans but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of babylon and shall speak with him mouth to mouth and his eyes shall behold his eyes and he shall lead zedekiah to babylon and there shall he be until i remember him saith the lord though ye fight with the chaldeans ye shall not prosper  and jeremiah said the word of the lord came unto me saying behold hanamel the son of shallum thine uncle shall come unto thee saying buy thee my field that is in anathoth for the right of redemption is thine to buy it so hanamel mine uncles son came to me in the court of the guard according to the word of the lord and said unto me buy my field i pray thee that is in anathoth which is in the land of benjamin for the right of inheritance is thine and the redemption is thine buy it for thyself then i knew that this was the word of the lord and i bought the field that was in anathoth of hanamel mine uncles son and weighed him the money even seventeen shekels of silver and i subscribed the deed and sealed it and called witnesses and weighed him the money in the balances so i took the deed of the purchase both that which was sealed containing the terms and conditions and that which was open and i delivered the deed of the purchase unto baruch the son of neriah the son of mahseiah in the presence of hanamel mine uncle and in the presence of the witnesses that subscribed the deed of the purchase before all the jews that sat in the court of the guard and i charged baruch before them saying thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel take these deeds this deed of the purchase both that which is sealed and this deed which is open and put them in an earthen vessel that they may continue many days s for thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel houses and fields and vineyards shall yet again be bought in this land  now after i had delivered the deed of the purchase unto baruch the son of neriah i prayed unto the lord saying ah lord god behold thou hast made the heaven and the earth by thy great power and by thy outstretched arm there is nothing too hard for thee who showest mercy unto thousands and recompensest the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them the great the mighty god the lord of hosts is his name great in counsel and mighty in work whose eyes are open upon all the ways of the sons of men to give every one according to his ways and according to the fruit of his doings who didst set signs and wonders in the land of egypt even unto this day and in israel and among other men and madest thee a name as at this day and didst bring forth thy people israel out of the land of egypt with signs and with wonders and with a strong hand and with an outstretched arm and with great terror and gavest them this land which thou didst swear to their fathers to give them a land flowing with milk and honey and they came in and possessed it but they hearkened not to thy voice neither walked in thy law they have done nothing of all that thou commandedst them to do therefore thou hast caused all this evil to befall them behold the mounds they are come unto the city to take it and the city is given into the hand of the chaldeans that fight against it because of the sword and of the famine and of the pestilence and what thou hast spoken is come to pass and behold thou seest it yet thou hast said unto me o lord god buy thee the field for money and call witnesses whereas the city is given into the hand of the chaldeans s then came the word of the lord unto jeremiah saying behold i am the lord the god of all flesh is there any thing too hard for me therefore thus saith the lord behold i will give this city into the hand of the chaldeans and into the hand of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon and he shall take it and the chaldeans that fight against this city shall come and set this city on fire and burn it with the houses upon whose roofs they have offered unto baal and poured out drinkofferings unto other gods to provoke me for the children of israel and the children of judah have only done that which was evil in my sight from their youth for the children of israel have only provoked me with the work of their hands saith the lord for this city hath been to me a provocation of mine anger and of my fury from the day that they built it even unto this day that i should remove it from before my face because of all the evil of the children of israel and of the children of judah which they have done to provoke me they their kings their princes their priests and their prophets and the men of judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem and they have turned unto me the back and not the face and though i taught them teaching them betimes and often yet they have not hearkened to receive instruction but they set their abominations in the house whereupon my name is called to defile it and they built the high places of baal which are in the valley of the son of hinnom to set apart their sons and their daughters unto molech which i commanded them not neither came it into my mind that they should do this abomination to cause judah to sin s and now therefore thus saith the lord the god of israel concerning this city whereof ye say it is given into the hand of the king of babylon by the sword and by the famine and by the pestilence behold i will gather them out of all the countries whither i have driven them in mine anger and in my fury and in great wrath and i will bring them back unto this place and i will cause them to dwell safely and they shall be my people and i will be their god and i will give them one heart and one way that they may fear me for ever for the good of them and of their children after them and i will make an everlasting covenant with them that i will not turn away from them to do them good and i will put my fear in their hearts that they shall not depart from me yea i will rejoice over them to do them good and i will plant them in this land in truth with my whole heart and with my whole soul s for thus saith the lord like as i have brought all this great evil upon this people so will i bring upon them all the good that i have promised them and fields shall be bought in this land whereof ye say it is desolate without man or beast it is given into the hand of the chaldeans men shall buy fields for money and subscribe the deeds and seal them and call witnesses in the land of benjamin and in the places about jerusalem and in the cities of judah and in the cities of the hillcountry and in the cities of the lowland and in the cities of the south for i will cause their captivity to return saith the lord  moreover the word of the lord came unto jeremiah the second time while he was yet shut up in the court of the guard saying thus saith the lord the maker thereof the lord that formed it to establish it the lord is his name call unto me and i will answer thee and will tell thee great things and hidden which thou knowest not  for thus saith the lord the god of israel concerning the houses of this city and concerning the houses of the kings of judah which are broken down for mounds and for ramparts whereon they come to fight with the chaldeans even to fill them with the dead bodies of men whom i have slain in mine anger and in my fury and for all whose wickedness i have hid my face from this city behold i will bring it healing and cure and i will cure them and i will reveal unto them the abundance of peace and truth and i will cause the captivity of judah and the captivity of israel to return and will build them as at the first and i will cleanse them from all their iniquity whereby they have sinned against me and i will pardon all their iniquities whereby they have sinned against me and whereby they have transgressed against me and this city shall be to me for a name of joy for a praise and for a glory before all the nations of the earth which shall hear all the good that i do unto them and shall fear and tremble for all the good and for all the peace that i procure unto it s thus saith the lord yet again there shall be heard in this place whereof ye say it is waste without ',\n",
       "  'man and without beast even in the cities of judah and in the streets of jerusalem that are desolate without man and without inhabitant and without beast the voice of joy and the voice of gladness the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride the voice of them that say give thanks to the lord of hosts for the lord is good for his mercy endureth for ever even of them that bring offerings of thanksgiving into the house of the lord for i will cause the captivity of the land to return as at the first saith the lord s thus saith the lord of hosts yet again shall there be in this place which is waste without man and without beast and in all the cities thereof a habitation of shepherds causing their flocks to lie down in the cities of the hillcountry in the cities of the lowland and in the cities of the south and in the land of benjamin and in the places about jerusalem and in the cities of judah shall the flocks again pass under the hands of him that counteth them saith the lord s behold the days come saith the lord that i will perform that good word which i have spoken concerning the house of israel and concerning the house of judah in those days and at that time will i cause a shoot of righteousness to grow up unto david and he shall execute justice and righteousness in the land in those days shall judah be saved and jerusalem shall dwell safely and this is the name whereby she shall be called the lord is our righteousness s for thus saith the lord there shall not be cut off unto david a man to sit upon the throne of the house of israel neither shall there be cut off unto the priests the levites a man before me to offer burntofferings and to burn mealofferings and to do sacrifice continually  and the word of the lord came unto jeremiah saying thus saith the lord if ye can break my covenant with the day and my covenant with the night so that there should not be day and night in their season then may also my covenant be broken with david my servant that he should not have a son to reign upon his throne and with the levites the priests my ministers as the host of heaven cannot be numbered neither the sand of the sea measured so will i multiply the seed of david my servant and the levites that minister unto me s and the word of the lord came to jeremiah saying considerest thou not what this people have spoken saying the two families which the lord did choose he hath cast them off and they contemn my people that they should be no more a nation before them s thus saith the lord if my covenant be not with day and night if i have not appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth then will i also cast away the seed of jacob and of david my servant so that i will not take of his seed to be rulers over the seed of abraham isaac and jacob for i will cause their captivity to return and will have compassion on them  the word which came unto jeremiah from the lord when nebuchadrezzar king of babylon and all his army and all the kingdoms of the land of his dominion and all the peoples fought against jerusalem and against all the cities thereof saying thus saith the lord the god of israel go and speak to zedekiah king of judah and tell him thus saith the lord behold i will give this city into the hand of the king of babylon and he shall burn it with fire and thou shalt not escape out of his hand but shalt surely be taken and delivered into his hand and thine eyes shall behold the eyes of the king of babylon and he shall speak with thee mouth to mouth and thou shalt go to babylon yet hear the word of the lord o zedekiah king of judah thus saith the lord concerning thee thou shalt not die by the sword thou shalt die in peace and with the burnings of thy fathers the former kings that were before thee so shall they make a burning for thee and they shall lament thee ah lord for i have spoken the word saith the lord s then jeremiah the prophet spoke all these words unto zedekiah king of judah in jerusalem when the king of babylons army fought against jerusalem and against all the cities of judah that were left against lachish and against azekah for these alone remained of the cities of judah as fortified cities  the word that came unto jeremiah from the lord after that the king zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people that were at jerusalem to proclaim liberty unto them that every man should let his manservant and every man his maidservant being a hebrew man or a hebrew woman go free that none should make bondmen of them even of a jew his brother and all the princes and all the people hearkened that had entered into the covenant to let every one his manservant and every one his maidservant go free and not to make bondmen of them any more they hearkened and let them go but afterwards they turned and caused the servants and the handmaids whom they had let go free to return and brought them into subjection for servants and for handmaids  therefore the word of the lord came to jeremiah from the lord saying thus saith the lord the god of israel i made a covenant with your fathers in the day that i brought them forth out of the land of egypt out of the house of bondage saying at the end of seven years ye shall let go every man his brother that is a hebrew that hath been sold unto thee and hath served thee six years thou shalt let him go free from thee but your fathers hearkened not unto me neither inclined their ear and ye were now turned and had done that which is right in mine eyes in proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbour and ye had made a covenant before me in the house whereon my name is called but ye turned and profaned my name and caused every man his servant and every man his handmaid whom ye had let go free at their pleasure to return and ye brought them into subjection to be unto you for servants and for handmaids s therefore thus saith the lord ye have not hearkened unto me to proclaim liberty every man to his brother and every man to his neighbour behold i proclaim for you a liberty saith the lord unto the sword unto the pestilence and unto the famine and i will make you a horror unto all the kingdoms of the earth and i will give the men that have transgressed my covenant that have not performed the words of the covenant which they made before me when they cut the calf in twain and passed between the parts thereof the princes of judah and the princes of jerusalem the officers and the priests and all the people of the land that passed between the parts of the calf i will even give them into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of them that seek their life and their dead bodies shall be for food unto the fowls of the heaven and to the beasts of the earth and zedekiah king of judah and his princes will i give into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of them that seek their life and into the hand of the king of babylons army that are gone up from you behold i will command saith the lord and cause them to return to this city and they shall fight against it and take it and burn it with fire and i will make the cities of judah a desolation without inhabitant  the word which came unto jeremiah from the lord in the days of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah saying go unto the house of the rechabites and speak unto them and bring them into the house of the lord into one of the chambers and give them wine to drink then i took jaazaniah the son of jeremiah the son of habazziniah and his brethren and all his sons and the whole house of the rechabites and i brought them into the house of the lord into the chamber of the sons of hanan the son of igdaliah the man of god which was by the chamber of the princes which was above the chamber of maaseiah the son of shallum the keeper of the door and i set before the sons of the house of the rechabites goblets full of wine and cups and i said unto them drink ye wine but they said we will drink no wine for jonadab the son of rechab our father commanded us saying ye shall drink no wine neither ye nor your sons for ever neither shall ye build house nor sow seed nor plant vineyard nor have any but all your days ye shall dwell in tents that ye may live many days in the land wherein ye sojourn and we have hearkened to the voice of jonadab the son of rechab our father in all that he charged us to drink no wine all our days we our wives our sons nor our daughters nor to build houses for us to dwell in neither to have vineyard or field or seed but we have dwelt in tents and have hearkened and done according to all that jonadab our father commanded us but it came to pass when nebuchadrezzar king of babylon came up against the land that we said come and let us go to jerusalem for fear of the army of the chaldeans and for fear of the army of the arameans so we dwell at jerusalem  then came the word of the lord unto jeremiah saying thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel go and say to the men of judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem will ye not receive instruction to hearken to my words saith the lord the words of jonadab the son of rechab that he commanded his sons not to drink wine are performed and unto this day they drink none for they hearken to their fathers commandment but i have spoken unto you speaking betimes and often and ye have not hearkened unto me i have sent also unto you all my servants the prophets sending them betimes and often saying return ye now every man from his evil way and amend your doings and go not after other gods to serve them and ye shall dwell in the land which i have given to you and to your fathers but ye have not inclined your ear nor hearkened unto me because the sons of jonadab the son of rechab have performed the commandment of their father which he commanded them but this people hath not hearkened unto me therefore thus saith the lord the god of hosts the god of israel behold i will bring upon judah and upon all the inhabitants of jerusalem all the evil that i have pronounced against them because i have spoken unto them but they have not heard and i have called unto them but they have not answered and unto the house of the rechabites jeremiah said thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel because ye have hearkened to the commandment of jonadab your father and kept all his precepts and done according unto all that he commanded you therefore thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel there shall not be cut off unto jonadab the son of rechab a man to stand before me for ever  and it came to pass in the fourth year of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah that this word came unto jeremiah from the lord saying take thee a roll of a book and write therein all the words that i have spoken unto thee against israel and against judah and against all the nations from the day i spoke unto thee from the days of josiah even unto this day it may be that the house of judah will ',\n",
       "  'hear all the evil which i purpose to do unto them that they may return every man from his evil way and i may forgive their iniquity and their sin s then jeremiah called baruch the son of neriah and baruch wrote from the mouth of jeremiah all the words of the lord which he had spoken unto him upon a roll of a book and jeremiah commanded baruch saying i am detained i cannot go into the house of the lord therefore go thou and read in the roll which thou hast written from my mouth the words of the lord in the ears of the people in the lords house upon a fastday and also thou shalt read them in the ears of all judah that come out of their cities it may be they will present their supplication before the lord and will return every one from his evil way for great is the anger and the fury that the lord hath pronounced against this people and baruch the son of neriah did according to all that jeremiah the prophet commanded him reading in the book the words of the lord in the lords house  now it came to pass in the fifth year of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah in the ninth month that they proclaimed a fast before the lord all the people in jerusalem and all the people that came from the cities of judah unto jerusalem then did baruch read in the book the words of jeremiah in the house of the lord in the chamber of gemariah the son of shaphan the scribe in the upper court at the entry of the new gate of the lords house in the ears of all the people and when micaiah the son of gemariah the son of shaphan had heard out of the book all the words of the lord he went down into the kings house into the scribes chamber and lo all the princes sat there even elishama the scribe and delaiah the son of shemaiah and elnathan the son of achbor and gemariah the son of shaphan and zedekiah the son of hananiah and all the princes then micaiah declared unto them all the words that he had heard when baruch read the book in the ears of the people therefore all the princes sent jehudi the son of nethaniah the son of shelemiah the son of cushi unto baruch saying take in thy hand the roll wherein thou hast read in the ears of the people and come so baruch the son of neriah took the roll in his hand and came unto them and they said unto him sit down now and read it in our ears so baruch read it in their ears now it came to pass when they had heard all the words they turned in fear one toward another and said unto baruch we will surely tell the king of all these words and they asked baruch saying tell us now how didst thou write all these words at his mouth then baruch answered them he pronounced all these words unto me with his mouth and i wrote them with ink in the book s then said the princes unto baruch go hide thee thou and jeremiah and let no man know where ye are and they went in to the king into the court but they had deposited the roll in the chamber of elishama the scribe and they told all the words in the ears of the king so the king sent jehudi to fetch the roll and he took it out of the chamber of elishama the scribe and jehudi read it in the ears of the king and in the ears of all the princes that stood beside the king now the king was sitting in the winterhouse in the ninth month and the brazier was burning before him and it came to pass when jehudi had read three or four columns that he cut it with the penknife and cast it into the fire that was in the brazier until all the roll was consumed in the fire that was in the brazier yet they were not afraid nor rent their garments neither the king nor any of his servants that heard all these words moreover elnathan and delaiah and gemariah had entreated the king not to burn the roll but he would not hear them and the king commanded jerahmeel the kings son and seraiah the son of azriel and shelemiah the son of abdeel to take baruch the scribe and jeremiah the prophet but the lord hid them s then the word of the lord came to jeremiah after that the king had burned the roll and the words which baruch wrote at the mouth of jeremiah saying take thee again another roll and write in it all the former words that were in the first roll which jehoiakim the king of judah hath burned and concerning jehoiakim king of judah thou shalt say thus saith the lord thou hast burned this roll saying why hast thou written therein saying the king of babylon shall certainly come and destroy this land and shall cause to cease from thence man and beast s therefore thus saith the lord concerning jehoiakim king of judah he shall have none to sit upon the throne of david and his dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heat and in the night to the frost and i will visit upon him and his seed and his servants their iniquity and i will bring upon them and upon the inhabitants of jerusalem and upon the men of judah all the evil that i have pronounced against them but they hearkened not then took jeremiah another roll and gave it to baruch the scribe the son of neriah who wrote therein from the mouth of jeremiah all the words of the book which jehoiakim king of judah had burned in the fire and there were added besides unto them many like words  and zedekiah the son of josiah reigned as king instead of coniah the son of jehoiakim whom nebuchadrezzar king of babylon made king in the land of judah but neither he nor his servants nor the people of the land did hearken unto the words of the lord which he spoke by the prophet jeremiah and zedekiah the king sent jehucal the son of shelemiah and zephaniah the son of maaseiah the priest to the prophet jeremiah saying pray now unto the lord our god for us now jeremiah came in and went out among the people for they had not put him into prison and pharaohs army was come forth out of egypt and when the chaldeans that besieged jerusalem heard tidings of them they broke up from jerusalem  then came the word of the lord unto the prophet jeremiah saying thus saith the lord the god of israel thus shall ye say to the king of judah that sent you unto me to inquire of me behold pharaohs army which is come forth to help you shall return to egypt into their own land and the chaldeans shall return and fight against this city and they shall take it and burn it with fire  thus saith the lord deceive not yourselves saying the chaldeans shall surely depart from us for they shall not depart for though ye had smitten the whole army of the chaldeans that fight against you and there remained but wounded men among them yet would they rise up every man in his tent and burn this city with fire and it came to pass that when the army of the chaldeans was broken up from jerusalem for fear of pharaohs army s then jeremiah went forth out of jerusalem to go into the land of benjamin to receive his portion there in the midst of the people and when he was in the gate of benjamin a captain of the ward was there whose name was irijah the son of shelemiah the son of hananiah and he laid hold on jeremiah the prophet saying thou fallest away to the chaldeans then said jeremiah it is false i fall not away to the chaldeans but he hearkened not to him so irijah laid hold on jeremiah and brought him to the princes and the princes were wroth with jeremiah and smote him and put him in prison in the house of jonathan the scribe for they had made that the prison when jeremiah was come into the dungeonhouse and into the cells and jeremiah had remained there many days then zedekiah the king sent and fetched him and the king asked him secretly in his house and said is there any word from the lord and jeremiah said there is he said also thou shalt be delivered into the hand of the king of babylon moreover jeremiah said unto king zedekiah wherein have i sinned against thee or against thy servants or against this people that ye have put me in prison where now are your prophets that prophesied unto you saying the king of babylon shall not come against you nor against this land and now hear i pray thee o my lord the king let my supplication i pray thee be presented before thee that thou cause me not to return to the house of jonathan the scribe lest i die there then zedekiah the king commanded and they committed jeremiah into the court of the guard and they gave him daily a loaf of bread out of the bakers street until all the bread in the city was spent thus jeremiah remained in the court of the guard and shephatiah the son of mattan and gedaliah the son of pashhur and jucal the son of shelemiah and pashhur the son of malchiah heard the words that jeremiah spoke unto all the people saying thus saith the lord he that remaineth in this city shall die by the sword by the famine and by the pestilence but he that goeth forth to the chaldeans shall live and his life shall be unto him for a prey and he shall live s thus saith the lord this city shall surely be given into the hand of the army of the king of babylon and he shall take it then the princes said unto the king let this man we pray thee be put to death forasmuch as he weakeneth the hands of the men of war that remain in this city and the hands of all the people in speaking such words unto them for this man seeketh not the welfare of this people but the hurt then zedekiah the king said behold he is in your hand for the king is not he that can do any thing against you then took they jeremiah and cast him into the pit of malchiah the kings son that was in the court of the guard and they let down jeremiah with cords and in the pit there was no water but mire and jeremiah sank in the mire s now when ebedmelech the ethiopian an officer who was in the kings house heard that they had put jeremiah in the pit the king then sitting in the gate of benjamin ebedmelech went forth out of the kings house and spoke to the king saying my lord the king these men have done evil in all that they have done to jeremiah the prophet whom they have cast into the pit and he is like to die in the place where he is because of the famine for there is no more bread in the city then the king commanded ebedmelech the ethiopian saying take from hence thirty men with thee and take up jeremiah the prophet out of the pit before he die so ebedmelech took the men with him and went into the house of the king under the treasury and took thence worn clouts and worn rags and let them down by cords into the pit to jeremiah and ebedmelech the ethiopian said unto jeremiah put now these worn clouts and rags under thine armholes under the cords and jeremiah did so so they drew up jeremiah with the cords and took him up out of the pit and jeremiah remained in the court of the guard s then zedekiah the king sent and took jeremiah the prophet unto him into the third entry that was in the house of the lord and the king said unto jeremiah i will ask thee a thing hide nothing from me then jeremiah said unto zedekiah if i declare it unto thee wilt thou not surely put me',\n",
       "  ' to death and if i give thee counsel thou wilt not hearken unto me so zedekiah the king swore secretly unto jeremiah saying as the lord liveth that made us this soul i will not put thee to death neither will i give thee into the hand of these men that seek thy life s then said jeremiah unto zedekiah s thus saith the lord the god of hosts the god of israel if thou wilt go forth unto the king of babylons princes then thy soul shall live and this city shall not be burned with fire and thou shalt live thou and thy house but if thou wilt not go forth to the king of babylons princes then shall this city be given into the hand of the chaldeans and they shall burn it with fire and thou shalt not escape out of their hand s and zedekiah the king said unto jeremiah i am afraid of the jews that are fallen away to the chaldeans lest they deliver me into their hand and they mock me but jeremiah said they shall not deliver thee hearken i beseech thee to the voice of the lord in that which i speak unto thee so it shall be well with thee and thy soul shall live but if thou refuse to go forth this is the word that the lord hath shown me behold all the women that are left in the king of judahs house shall be brought forth to the king of babylons princes and those women shall say thy familiar friends have set thee on and have prevailed over thee thy feet are sunk in the mire and they are turned away back and they shall bring out all thy wives and thy children to the chaldeans and thou shalt not escape out of their hand but shalt be taken by the hand of the king of babylon and thou shalt cause this city to be burned with fire s then said zedekiah unto jeremiah let no man know of these words and thou shalt not die but if the princes hear that i have talked with thee and they come unto thee and say unto thee declare unto us now what thou hast said unto the king hide it not from us and we will not put thee to death also what the king said unto thee then thou shalt say unto them i presented my supplication before the king that he would not cause me to return to jonathans house to die there  then came all the princes unto jeremiah and asked him and he told them according to all these words that the king had commanded so they left off speaking with him for the matter was not reported so jeremiah abode in the court of the guard until the day that jerusalem was taken s and it came to pass when jerusalem was taken in the ninth year of zedekiah king of judah in the tenth month came nebuchadrezzar king of babylon and all his army against jerusalem and besieged it in the eleventh year of zedekiah in the fourth month the ninth day of the month a breach was made in the city that all the princes of the king of babylon came in and sat in the middle gate even nergalsarezer samgarnebo sarsechim rabsaris nergalsarezer rabmag with all the residue of the princes of the king of babylon and it came to pass that when zedekiah the king of judah and all the men of war saw them then they fled and went forth out of the city by night by the way of the kings garden by the gate betwixt the two walls and he went out the way of the arabah but the army of the chaldeans pursued after them and overtook zedekiah in the plains of jericho and when they had taken him they brought him up to nebuchadrezzar king of babylon to riblah in the land of hamath and he gave judgment upon him then the king of babylon slew the sons of zedekiah in riblah before his eyes also the king of babylon slew all the nobles of judah moreover he put out zedekiahs eyes and bound him in fetters to carry him to babylon and the chaldeans burned the kings house and the house of the people with fire and broke down the walls of jerusalem then nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive into babylon the remnant of the people that remained in the city the deserters also that fell away to him with the rest of the people that remained but nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people that had nothing in the land of judah and gave them vineyards and fields in that day now nebuchadrezzar king of babylon gave charge concerning jeremiah to nebuzaradan the captain of the guard saying take him and look well to him and do him no harm but do unto him even as he shall say unto thee so nebuzaradan the captain of the guard sent and nebushazban rabsaris and nergalsarezer rabmag and all the chief officers of the king of babylon they sent and took jeremiah out of the court of the guard and committed him unto gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan that he should carry him home so he dwelt among the people s now the word of the lord came unto jeremiah while he was shut up in the court of the guard saying go and speak to ebedmelech the ethiopian saying thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel behold i will bring my words upon this city for evil and not for good and they shall be accomplished before thee in that day but i will deliver thee in that day saith the lord and thou shalt not be given into the hand of the men of whom thou art afraid for i will surely deliver thee and thou shalt not fall by the sword but thy life shall be for a prey unto thee because thou hast put thy trust in me saith the lord  the word which came to jeremiah from the lord after that nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had let him go from ramah when he had taken him being bound in chains among all the captives of jerusalem and judah that were carried away captive unto babylon and the captain of the guard took jeremiah and said unto him the lord thy god pronounced this evil upon this place and the lord hath brought it and done according as he spoke because ye have sinned against the lord and have not hearkened to his voice therefore this thing is come upon you and now behold i loose thee this day from the chains which are upon thy hand if it seem good unto thee to come with me into babylon come and i will look well unto thee but if it seem ill unto thee to come with me into babylon forbear behold all the land is before thee whither it seemeth good and right unto thee to go thither go yet he would not go backgo back then to gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan whom the king of babylon hath made governor over the cities of judah and dwell with him among the people or go wheresoever it seemeth right unto thee to go so the captain of the guard gave him an allowance and a present and let him go then went jeremiah unto gedaliah the son of ahikam to mizpah and dwelt with him among the people that were left in the land  now when all the captains of the forces that were in the fields even they and their men heard that the king of babylon had made gedaliah the son of ahikam governor in the land and had committed unto him men and women and children and of the poorest of the land of them that were not carried away captive to babylon then they came to gedaliah to mizpah even ishmael the son of nethaniah and johanan and jonathan the sons of kareah and seraiah the son of tanhumeth and the sons of ephai the netophathite and jezaniah the son of the maacathite they and their men and gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan swore unto them and to their men saying fear not to serve the chaldeans dwell in the land and serve the king of babylon and it shall be well with you as for me behold i will dwell at mizpah to stand before the chaldeans that may come unto us but ye gather ye wine and summer fruits and oil and put them in your vessels and dwell in your cities that ye have taken likewise when all the jews that were in moab and among the children of ammon and in edom and that were in all the countries heard that the king of babylon had left a remnant of judah and that he had set over them gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan then all the jews returned out of all places whither they were driven and came to the land of judah to gedaliah unto mizpah and gathered wine and summer fruits in great abundance s moreover johanan the son of kareah and all the captains of the forces that were in the fields came to gedaliah to mizpah and said unto him dost thou know that baalis the king of the children of ammon hath sent ishmael the son of nethaniah to take thy life but gedaliah the son of ahikam believed them not then johanan the son of kareah spoke to gedaliah in mizpah secretly saying let me go i pray thee and i will slay ishmael the son of nethaniah and no man shall know it wherefore should he take thy life that all the jews that are gathered unto thee should be scattered and the remnant of judah perish but gedaliah the son of ahikam said unto johanan the son of kareah thou shalt not do this thing for thou speakest falsely of ishmael  now it came to pass in the seventh month that ishmael the son of nethaniah the son of elishama of the seed royal and one of the chief officers of the king and ten men with him came unto gedaliah the son of ahikam to mizpah and there they did eat bread together in mizpah then arose ishmael the son of nethaniah and the ten men that were with him and smote gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan with the sword and slew him whom the king of babylon had made governor over the land ishmael also slew all the jews that were with him even with gedaliah at mizpah and the chaldeans that were found there even the men of war and it came to pass the second day after he had slain gedaliah and no man knew it that there came certain men from shechem from shiloh and from samaria even fourscore men having their beards shaven and their clothes rent and having cut themselves with mealofferings and frankincense in their hand to bring them to the house of the lord and ishmael the son of nethaniah went forth from mizpah to meet them weeping all along as he went and it came to pass as he met them he said unto them come to gedaliah the son of ahikam and it was so when they came into the midst of the city that ishmael the son of nethaniah slew them and cast them into the midst of the pit he and the men that were with him but ten men were found among them that said unto ishmael slay us not for we have stores hidden in the field of wheat and of barley and of oil and of honey so he forbore and slew them not among their brethren now the pit wherein ishmael cast all the dead bodies of the men whom he had slain by the side of gedaliah was that which asa the king had made for fear of baasa king of israel the same ishmael the son of nethaniah filled with them that were slain then ishmael carried away captive all the residue of the people that were in mizpah even the kings daughters and all the people that remained in mizpah whom nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had committed to gedaliah the son of ahikam ishmael the son of nethaniah carried them away captive and departed to go over to the children of ammon s but when johanan the son of kareah and al',\n",
       "  'l the captains of the forces that were with him heard of all the evil that ishmael the son of nethaniah had done then they took all the men and went to fight with ishmael the son of nethaniah and found him by the great waters that are in gibeon now it came to pass that when all the people that were with ishmael saw johanan the son of kareah and all the captains of the forces that were with him then they were glad so all the people that ishmael had carried away captive from mizpah cast about and returned and went unto johanan the son of kareah but ishmael the son of nethaniah escaped from johanan with eight men and went to the children of ammon s then took johanan the son of kareah and all the captains of the forces that were with him all the remnant of the people whom he had recovered from ishmael the son of nethaniah from mizpah after that he had slain gedaliah the son of ahikam the men even the men of war and the women and the children and the officers whom he had brought back from gibeon and they departed and dwelt in geruth chimham which is by bethlehem to go to enter into egypt because of the chaldeans for they were afraid of them because ishmael the son of nethaniah had slain gedaliah the son of ahikam whom the king of babylon made governor over the land  then all the captains of the forces and johanan the son of kareah and jezaniah the son of hoshaiah and all the people from the least even unto the greatest came near and said unto jeremiah the prophet let we pray thee our supplication be accepted before thee and pray for us unto the lord thy god even for all this remnant for we are left but a few of many as thine eyes do behold us that the lord thy god may tell us the way wherein we should walk and the thing that we should do then jeremiah the prophet said unto them i have heard you behold i will pray unto the lord your god according to your words and it shall come to pass that whatsoever thing the lord shall answer you i will declare it unto you i will keep nothing back from you then they said to jeremiah the lord be a true and faithful witness against us if we do not even according to all the word wherewith the lord thy god shall send thee to us whether it be good or whether it be evil we will hearken to the voice of the lord our god to whom we send thee that it may be well with us when we hearken to the voice of the lord our god  and it came to pass after ten days that the word of the lord came unto jeremiah then called he johanan the son of kareah and all the captains of the forces that were with him and all the people from the least even to the greatest and said unto them thus saith the lord the god of israel unto whom ye sent me to present your supplication before him if ye will still abide in this land then will i build you and not pull you down and i will plant you and not pluck you up for i repent me of the evil that i have done unto you be not afraid of the king of babylon of whom ye are afraid be not afraid of him saith the lord for i am with you to save you and to deliver you from his hand and i will grant you compassion that he may have compassion upon you and cause you to return to your own land but if ye say we will not abide in this land so that ye hearken not to the voice of the lord your god saying no but we will go into the land of egypt where we shall see no war nor hear the sound of the horn nor have hunger of bread and there will we abide now therefore hear ye the word of the lord o remnant of judah thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel if ye wholly set your faces to enter into egypt and go to sojourn there then it shall come to pass that the sword which ye fear shall overtake you there in the land of egypt and the famine whereof ye are afraid shall follow hard after you there in egypt and there ye shall die so shall it be with all the men that set their faces to go into egypt to sojourn there they shall die by the sword by the famine and by the pestilence and none of them shall remain or escape from the evil that i will bring upon them for thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel as mine anger and my fury hath been poured forth upon the inhabitants of jerusalem so shall my fury be poured forth upon you when ye shall enter into egypt and ye shall be an execration and an astonishment and a curse and a reproach and ye shall see this place no more the lord hath spoken concerning you o remnant of judah go ye not into egypt know certainly that i have forewarned you this day for ye have dealt deceitfully against your own souls for ye sent me unto the lord your god saying pray for us unto the lord our god and according unto all that the lord our god shall say so declare unto us and we will do it and i have this day declared it to you but ye have not hearkened to the voice of the lord your god in any thing for which he hath sent me unto you now therefore know certainly that ye shall die by the sword by the famine and by the pestilence in the place whither ye desire to go to sojourn there s and it came to pass that when jeremiah had made an end of speaking unto all the people all the words of the lord their god wherewith the lord their god had sent him to them even all these words s then spoke azariah the son of hoshaiah and johanan the son of kareah and all the proud men saying unto jeremiah thou speakest falsely the lord our god hath not sent thee to say ye shall not go into egypt to sojourn there but baruch the son of neriah setteth thee on against us to deliver us into the hand of the chaldeans that they may put us to death and carry us away captives to babylon so johanan the son of kareah and all the captains of the forces and all the people hearkened not to the voice of the lord to dwell in the land of judah but johanan the son of kareah and all the captains of the forces took all the remnant of judah that were returned from all the nations whither they had been driven to sojourn in the land of judah the men and the women and the children and the kings daughters and every person that nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had left with gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan and jeremiah the prophet and baruch the son of neriah and they came into the land of egypt for they hearkened not to the voice of the lord and they came even to tahpanhes s then came the word of the lord unto jeremiah in tahpanhes saying take great stones in thy hand and hide them in the mortar in the framework which is at the entry of pharaohs house in tahpanhes in the sight of the men of judah and say unto them thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel behold i will send and take nebuchadrezzar the king of babylon my servant and will set his throne upon these stones that i have hid and he shall spread his royal pavilion over them and he shall come and shall smite the land of egypt such as are for death to death and such as are for captivity to captivity and such as are for the sword to the sword and i will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of egypt and he shall burn them and carry them away captives and he shall fold up the land of egypt as a shepherd foldeth up his garment and he shall go forth from thence in peace he shall also break the pillars of bethshemesh that is in the land of egypt and the houses of the gods of egypt shall he burn with fire  the word that came to jeremiah concerning all the jews that dwelt in the land of egypt that dwelt at migdol and at tahpanhes and at noph and in the country of pathros saying thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel ye have seen all the evil that i have brought upon jerusalem and upon all the cities of judah and behold this day they are a desolation and no man dwelleth therein because of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke me in that they went to offer and to serve other gods whom they knew not neither they nor ye nor your fathers howbeit i sent unto you all my servants the prophets sending them betimes and often saying oh do not this abominable thing that i hate but they hearkened not nor inclined their ear to turn from their wickedness to forbear offering unto other gods wherefore my fury and mine anger was poured forth and was kindled in the cities of judah and in the streets of jerusalem and they are wasted and desolate as at this day s therefore now thus saith the lord the god of hosts the god of israel wherefore commit ye this great evil against your own souls to cut off from you man and woman infant and suckling out of the midst of judah to leave you none remaining in that ye provoke me with the works of your hands offering unto other gods in the land of egypt whither ye are gone to sojourn that ye may be cut off and that ye may be a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth have ye forgotten the wicked deeds of your fathers and the wicked deeds of the kings of judah and the wicked deeds of their wives and your own wicked deeds and the wicked deeds of your wives which they committed in the land of judah and in the streets of jerusalem they are not humbled even unto this day neither have they feared nor walked in my law nor in my statutes that i set before you and before your fathers s therefore thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel behold i will set my face against you for evil even to cut off all judah and i will take the remnant of judah that have set their faces to go into the land of egypt to sojourn there and they shall all be consumed in the land of egypt shall they fall they shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine they shall die from the least even unto the greatest by the sword and by the famine and they shall be an execration and an astonishment and a curse and a reproach for i will punish them that dwell in the land of egypt as i have punished jerusalem by the sword by the famine and by the pestilence so that none of the remnant of judah that are gone into the land of egypt to sojourn there shall escape or remain that they should return into the land of judah to which they have a desire to return to dwell there for none shall return save such as shall escape  then all the men who knew that their wives offered unto other gods and all the women that stood by a great assembly even all the people that dwelt in the land of egypt in pathros answered jeremiah saying as for the word that thou hast spoken unto us in the name of the lord we will not hearken unto thee but we will certainly perform every word that is gone forth out of our mouth to offer unto the queen of heaven and to pour out drinkofferings unto her as we have done we and our fathers our kings and our princes in the cities of judah and in the streets of jerusalem for then had we plenty of food and were well and saw no evil but since we let off to offer to the queen of heaven and to pour out drinkofferings unto her we have wanted all things and have been consume',\n",
       "  'd by the sword and by the famine and is it we that offer to the queen of heaven and pour out drinkofferings unto her did we make her cakes in her image and pour out drinkofferings unto her without our husbands s then jeremiah said unto all the people to the men and to the women even to all the people that had given him that answer saying the offering that ye offered in the cities of judah and in the streets of jerusalem ye and your fathers your kings and your princes and the people of the land did not the lord remember them and came it not into his mind so that the lord could no longer bear because of the evil of your doings and because of the abominations which ye have committed therefore is your land become a desolation and an astonishment and a curse without an inhabitant as at this day because ye have offered and because ye have sinned against the lord and have not hearkened to the voice of the lord nor walked in his law nor in his statutes nor in his testimonies therefore this evil is happened unto you as at this day s moreover jeremiah said unto all the people and to all the women hear the word of the lord all judah that are in the land of egypt thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel saying ye and your wives have both spoken with your mouths and with your hands have fulfilled it saying we will surely perform our vows that we have vowed to offer to the queen of heaven and to pour out drinkofferings unto her ye shall surely establish your vows and surely perform your vows s therefore hear ye the word of the lord all judah that dwell in the land of egypt behold i have sworn by my great name saith the lord that my name shall no more be named in the mouth of any man of judah in all the land of egypt saying as the lord god liveth behold i watch over them for evil and not for good and all the men of judah that are in the land of egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine until there be an end of them and they that escape the sword shall return out of the land of egypt into the land of judah few in number and all the remnant of judah that are gone into the land of egypt to sojourn there shall know whose word shall stand mine or theirs and this shall be the sign unto you saith the lord that i will punish you in this place that ye may know that my words shall surely stand against you for evil  thus saith the lord behold i will give pharaoh hophra king of egypt into the hand of his enemies and into the hand of them that seek his life as i gave zedekiah king of judah into the hand of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon his enemy and that sought his life s the word that jeremiah the prophet spoke unto baruch the son of neriah when he wrote these words in a book at the mouth of jeremiah in the fourth year of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah saying thus saith the lord the god of israel concerning thee o baruch thou didst say woe is me now for the lord hath added sorrow to my pain i am weary with my groaning and i find no rest thus shalt thou say unto him thus saith the lord behold that which i have built will i break down and that which i have planted i will pluck up and this in the whole land and seekest thou great things for thyself seek them not for behold i will bring evil upon all flesh saith the lord but thy life will i give unto thee for a prey in all places whither thou goest  the word of the lord which came to jeremiah the prophet concerning the nations of egypt concerning the army of pharaohneco king of egypt which was by the river euphrates in carchemish which nebuchadrezzar king of babylon smote in the fourth year of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah make ready buckler and shield and draw near to battle harness the horses and mount ye horsemen and stand forth with your helmets furbish the spears put on the coats of mail wherefore do i see them dismayed and turned backward and their mighty ones are beaten down and they are fled apace and look not back terror is on every side saith the lord the swift cannot flee away nor the mighty man escape in the north by the river euphrates have they stumbled and fallen who is this like the nile that riseth up like the rivers whose waters toss themselves egypt is like the nile that riseth up and like the rivers whose waters toss themselves and he saith i will rise up i will cover the earth i will destroy the city and the inhabitants thereof prance ye horses and rush madly ye chariots and let the mighty men go forth cush and put that handle the shield and the ludim that handle and bend the bow for the lord god of hosts shall have on that day a day of vengeance that he may avenge him of his adversaries and the sword shall devour and be satiate and shall be made drunk with their blood for the lord god of hosts hath a sacrifice in the north country by the river euphrates go up into gilead and take balm o virgin daughter of egypt in vain dost thou use many medicines there is no cure for thee the nations have heard of thy shame and the earth is full of thy cry for the mighty man hath stumbled against the mighty they are fallen both of them together  the word that the lord spoke to jeremiah the prophet how that nebuchadrezzar king of babylon should come and smite the land of egypt declare ye in egypt and announce in migdol and announce in noph and in tahpanhes say ye stand forth and prepare thee for the sword hath devoured round about thee why is thy strong one overthrown he stood not because the lord did thrust him down he made many to stumble yea they fell one upon another and said arise and let us return to our own people and to the land of our birth from the oppressing sword they cried there pharaoh king of egypt is but a noise he hath let the appointed time pass by as i live saith the king whose name is the lord of hosts surely like tabor among the mountains and like carmel by the sea so shall he come o thou daughter that dwellest in egypt furnish thyself to go into captivity for noph shall become a desolation and shall be laid waste without inhabitant s egypt is a very fair heifer but the gadfly out of the north is come it is come also her mercenaries in the midst of her are like calves of the stall for they also are turned back they are fled away together they did not stand for the day of their calamity is come upon them the time of their visitation the sound thereof shall go like the serpents for they march with an army and come against her with axes as hewers of wood they cut down her forest saith the lord though it cannot be searched because they are more than the locusts and are innumerable the daughter of egypt is put to shame she is delivered into the hand of the people of the north the lord of hosts the god of israel saith behold i will punish amon of no and pharaoh and egypt with her gods and her kings even pharaoh and them that trust in him and i will deliver them into the hand of those that seek their lives and into the hand of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon and into the hand of his servants and afterwards it shall be inhabited as in the days of old saith the lord  but fear not thou o jacob my servant neither be dismayed o israel for lo i will save thee from afar and thy seed from the land of their captivity and jacob shall again be quiet and at ease and none shall make him afraid fear not thou o jacob my servant saith the lord for i am with thee for i will make a full end of all the nations whither i have driven thee but i will not make a full end of thee and i will correct thee in measure but will not utterly destroy thee  the word of the lord that came to jeremiah the prophet concerning the philistines before that pharaoh smote gaza thus saith the lord behold waters rise up out of the north and shall become an overflowing stream and they shall overflow the land and all that is therein the city and them that dwell therein and the men shall cry and all the inhabitants of the land shall wail at the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his strong ones at the rushing of his chariots at the rumbling of his wheels the fathers look not back to their children for feebleness of hands because of the day that cometh to spoil all the philistines to cut off from tyre and zidon every helper that remaineth for the lord will spoil the philistines the remnant of the isle of caphtor baldness is come upon gaza ashkelon is brought to nought the remnant of their valley how long wilt thou cut thyself o thou sword of the lord how long will it be ere thou be quiet put up thyself into thy scabbard rest and be still how canst thou be quiet for the lord hath given it a charge against ashkelon and against the seashore there hath he appointed it  of moab thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel woe unto nebo for it is spoiled kiriathaim is put to shame it is taken misgab is put to shame and dismayed the praise of moab is no more in heshbon they have devised evil against her come and let us cut her off from being a nation thou also o madmen shalt be brought to silence the sword shall pursue thee hark a cry from horonaim spoiling and great destruction moab is destroyed her little ones have caused a cry to be heard for by the ascent of luhith with continual weeping shall they go up for in the going down of horonaim they have heard the distressing cry of destruction flee save your lives and be like a tamarisk in the wilderness for because thou hast trusted in thy works and in thy treasures thou also shalt be taken and chemosh shall go forth into captivity his priests and his princes together and the spoiler shall come upon every city and no city shall escape the valley also shall perish and the plain shall be destroyed as the lord hath spoken give wings unto moab for she must fly and get away and her cities shall become a desolation without any to dwell therein cursed be he that doeth the work of the lord with a slack hand and cursed be he that keepeth back his sword from blood moab hath been at ease from his youth and he hath settled on his lees and hath not been emptied from vessel to vessel neither hath he gone into captivity therefore his taste remaineth in him and his scent is not changed s therefore behold the days come saith the lord that i will send unto him them that tilt up and they shall tilt him up and they shall empty his vessels and break their bottles in pieces and moab shall be ashamed of chemosh as the house of israel was ashamed of bethel their confidence how say ye we are mighty men and valiant men for the war moab is spoiled and they are gone up into her cities and his chosen young men are gone down to the slaughter saith the king whose name is the lord of hosts the calamity of moab is near to come and his affliction hasteth fast bemoan him all ye that are round about him and all ye that know his name say how is the strong staff broken the beautiful rod o thou daughter that dwellest in',\n",

upon all the cities of the land of moab far or near the horn of moab is cut off and his arm is broken saith the lord make ye him drunken for he magnified himself against the lord and moab shall wallow in his vomit and he also shall be in derision for was not israel a derision unto thee was he found among thieves for as often as thou speakest of him thou waggest the head o ye that dwell in moab leave the cities and dwell in the rock and be like the dove that maketh her nest in the sides of the pits mouth we have heard of the pride of moab he is very proud his loftiness and his pride and his haughtiness and the assumption of his heart i know his arrogancy saith the lord that it is illfounded his boastings have wrought nothing wellfounded therefore will i wail for moab yea i will cry out for all moab for the men of kirheres shall my heart moan with more than the weeping of jazer will i weep for thee o vine of sibmah thy branches passed over the sea they reached even to the sea of jazer upon thy summer fruits and upon thy vintage the spoiler is fallen and gladness and joy is taken away from the fruitful field and from the land of moab and i have caused wine to cease from the winepresses none shall tread with shouting the shouting shall be no shouting from the cry of heshbon even unto elealeh even unto jahaz have they uttered their voice from zoar even unto horonaim a heifer of three years old for the waters of nimrim also shall be desolate moreover i will cause to cease in moab saith the lord him that offereth in the high place and him that offereth to his gods therefore my heart moaneth for moab like pipes and my heart moaneth like pipes for the men of kirheres therefore the abundance that he hath gotten is perished for every head is bald and every beard clipped upon all the hands are cuttings and upon the loins sackcloth on all the housetops of moab and in the broad places thereof there is lamentation every where for i have broken moab like a vessel wherein is no pleasure saith the lord how is it broken down wail ye how hath moab turned the back with shame so shall moab become a derision and a dismay to all that are round about him s for thus saith the lord behold he shall swoop as a vulture and shall spread out his wings against moab the cities are taken and the strongholds are seized and the heart of the mighty men of moab at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs and moab shall be destroyed from being a people because he hath magnified himself against the lord terror and the pit and the trap are upon thee o inhabitant of moab saith the lord he that fleeth from the terror shall fall into the pit and he that getteth up out of the pit shall be taken in the trap for i will bring upon her even upon moab the year of their visitation saith the lord in the shadow of heshbon the fugitives stand without strength for a fire is gone forth out of heshbon and a flame from the midst of sihon and it devoureth the corner of moab and the crown of the head of the tumultuous ones woe unto thee o moab the people of chemosh is undone for thy sons are taken away captive and thy daughters into captivity yet will i turn the captivity of moab in the end of days saith the lord thus far is the judgment of moab s of the children of ammon thus saith the lord hath israel no sons hath he no heir why then doth malcam take possession of gad and his people dwell in the cities thereof therefore behold the days come saith the lord that i will cause an alarm of war to be heard against rabbah of the children of ammon

daughters of rabbah gird you with sackcloth lament and run to and fro among the folds for malcam shall go into captivity his priests and his princes together wherefore gloriest thou in the valleys thy flowing valley o backsliding daughter that didst trust in thy treasures who shall come unto me behold i will bring a terror upon thee saith the lord god of hosts from all that are round about thee and

not go unpunished but thou shalt surely drink for i have sworn by myself saith the lord that bozrah shall become an astonishment a reproach a waste and a curse and all the cities thereof shall be perpetual wastes i have heard a message from the lord and an ambassador is sent among the nations gather yourselves together and come against her and rise up to the battle for behold i make thee small among the nations and despised among men thy terribleness hath deceived thee even the pride of thy heart o thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock that holdest the height of the hill though thou

waters the noise of their voice is uttered for the spoiler is come upon her even upon babylon and her mighty men are taken their bows are shattered for the lord is a god of recompenses he will surely requite and i will make drunk her princes and her wise men her governors and her deputies and her mighty men and they shall sleep a perpetual sleep and not wake saith the king whose name is the lord of hosts s thus saith the lord of hosts the broad walls of babylon shall be utterly overthrown and her high gates shall be burned with fire and the peoples shall labour for vanity and the nations for the fire and they shall be weary s the word which jeremiah the prophet commanded seraiah the son of neriah the son of mahseiah when he went with zedekiah the king of judah to babylon in the fourth year of his reign now seraiah was quartermaster and jeremiah wrote in one book all the evil that should come upon babylon even all these words that are written concerning babylon and jeremiah said to seraiah when thou comest to babylon then see that thou read all these words and say o lord thou hast spoken concerning this place to cut it off that none shall dwell therein neither man nor beast but that it shall be desolate for ever and it shall be when thou hast made an end of reading this book that thou shalt bind a stone to it and cast it into the midst of the euphrates and thou shalt say thus shall babylon sink and shall not rise again because of the evil that i will bring upon her and they shall be weary thus far are the words of jeremiah  zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign and he reigned eleven years in jerusalem and his mothers name was hamutal the daughter of jeremiah of libnah and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord according to all that jehoiakim had done for through the anger of the lord did it come to pass in jerusalem and judah until he had cast them out from his presence and zedekiah rebelled against the king of babylon and it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign in the tenth month in the tenth day of the month that nebuchadrezzar king of babylon came he and all his army against jerusalem and encamped against it and they built forts against it round about so the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king zedekiah in the fourth month in the ninth day of the month the famine was sore in the city so that there was no bread for the people of the land then a breach was made in the city and all the men of war fled and went forth out of the city by night by the way of the gate between the two walls which was by the kings gardennow the chaldeans were against the city round aboutand they went by the way of the arabah but the army of the chaldeans pursued after the king and overtook zedekiah in the plains of jericho and all his army was scattered from him then they took the king and carried him up unto the king of babylon to riblah in the land of hamath and he gave judgment upon him and the king of babylon slew the sons of zedekiah before his eyes he slew also all the princes of judah in riblah and he put out the eyes of zedekiah and the king of babylon bound him in fetters and carried him to babylon and put him in prison till the day of his death now in the fifth month in the tenth day of the month which was the nineteenth year of king nebuchadrezzar king of babylon came nebuzaradan the captain of the guard who stood before the king of babylon into jerusalem and he burned the house of the lord and the kings house and all the houses of jerusalem even every great mans house burned he with fire and all the army of the chaldeans that were with the captain of the guard broke down all the walls of jerusalem round about then nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive of

nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them and brought them to the king of babylon to riblah and the king of babylon smote them and put them to death at riblah in the land of hamath so judah was

call upon me in the day of trouble i will deliver thee and thou shalt honour me but unto the wicked god saith what hast thou to do to declare my statutes and that thou hast taken my covenant in thy mouth seeing thou hatest instruction and castest my words behind thee when thou sawest a thief thou hadst company with him and with adulterers was thy portion thou hast let loose thy mouth for evil

also upon all thy work and muse on thy doings o god thy way is in holiness who is a great god like unto god thou art the god that doest wonders thou hast made known thy strength among the peoples thou hast with thine arm redeemed thy people the sons of jacob and joseph selah the waters saw thee o god the waters saw thee they were in pain the depths also trembled the clouds flooded forth waters the skies sent out a sound thine arrows also went abroad the voice of thy thunder was in the whirlwind the lightnings lighted up the world the earth trembled and shook thy way was in the sea and thy path in the great waters and thy footsteps were not known thou didst lead thy people like a flock by the hand of moses and aaron  maschil of asaph ngive ear o my people to my teaching incline your ears to the words of my mouth i will open my mouth with a parable i will utter dark sayings concerning days of old that which we have heard and known and our fathers have told us we will not hide from their children telling to the generation to come the praises of the lord nand his strength and his wondrous works that he hath done for he established a testimony in jacob and appointed a law in israel nwhich he commanded our fathers that they should make them known to their children that the generation to come might know them even the children that should be born who should arise and tell them to their children that they might put their confidence in god and not forget the works of god but keep his commandments and might not be as their fathers a stubborn and rebellious generation na generation that set not their heart aright and whose spirit was not stedfast with god the children of ephraim were as archers handling the bow that turned back in the day of battle they kept not the covenant of god and refused to walk in his law and they forgot his doings and his wondrous works that he had shown them marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers in the land of egypt in the field of zoan he cleaved the sea and caused them to pass through and he made the waters to stand as a heap by day also he led them with a cloud and all the night with a light of fire he cleaved rocks in the wilderness and gave them drink abundantly as out of the great deep he brought streams also out of the rock and caused waters to run down like rivers yet went they on still to sin against him to rebel against the most high in the desert and they tried god in their heart by asking food for their craving yea they spoke against god they said can god prepare a table in the wilderness behold he smote the rock that waters gushed out and streams overflowed ncan he give bread also or will he provide flesh for his people therefore the lord heard and was wroth nand a fire was kindled against jacob and anger also went up against israel because they believed not in god and trusted not in his salvation and he commanded the skies above and opened the doors of heaven and he caused manna to rain upon them for food and gave them of the corn of heaven man did eat the bread of the mighty he sent them provisions to the full he caused the east wind to set forth in heaven and by his power he brought on the south wind he caused flesh also to rain upon them as the dust and winged fowl as the sand of the seas and he let it fall in the midst of their camp round about their dwellings so they did eat and were well filled and he gave them that which they craved they were not estranged from their craving their food was yet in their mouths when the anger of god went up against them and slew of the lustieth among them nand smote down the young men of israel for all this they sinned still and believed not in his wondrous works therefore he ended their days as a breath and their years in terror when he slew them then they would inquire after him and turn back and seek god earnestly and they remembered that god was their rock and the most high god their redeemer but they beguiled him with their mouth and lied unto him with their tongue for their heart was not stedfast with him neither were they faithful in his covenant but he being full of compassion forgiveth iniquity and destroyeth not nyea many a time doth he turn his anger away and doth not stir up all his wrath so he remembered that they were but flesh a wind that passeth away and cometh not again how oft did they rebel against him in the wilderness and grieve him in the desert and still again they tried god and set bounds to the holy one of israel they remembered not his hand nor the day when he redeemed them from the adversary how he set his signs in egypt and his wonders in the field of zoan and turned their rivers into blood so that they could not drink their streams he sent among them swarms of flies which devoured them and frogs which destroyed them he gave also their increase unto the caterpillar and their labour unto the locust he destroyed their vines with hail and their sycamoretrees with frost he gave over their cattle also to the hail and their flocks to fiery bolts he sent forth upon them the fierceness of his anger wrath and indignation and trouble a sending of messengers of evil he levelled a path for his anger he spared not their soul from death but gave their life over to the pestilence and smote all the firstborn in egypt the firstfruits of their strength in the tents of ham but he made his own people to go forth like sheep and guided them in the wilderness like a flock and he led them safely and they feared not but the sea overwhelmed their enemies and he brought them to his holy border to the mountain which his right hand had gotten he drove out the nations also before them and allotted them for an inheritance by line nand made the tribes of israel to dwell in their tents yet they tried and provoked god the most high and kept not his testimonies but turned back and dealt treacherously like their fathers they were turned aside like a deceitful bow for they provoked him with their high places and moved him to jealousy with their graven images god heard and was wroth and he greatly abhorred israel and he forsook the tabernacle of shiloh the tent which he had made to dwell among men and delivered his strength into captivity and his glory into the adversarys hand he gave his people over also unto the sword and was wroth with his inheritance fire devoured their young men and their virgins had no marriagesong their priests fell by the sword and their widows made no lamentation then the lord awaked as one asleep like a mighty man recovering from wine and he smote his adversaries backward he put upon them a perpetual reproach moreover he abhorred the tent of joseph and chose not the tribe of ephraim but chose the tribe of judah the mount zion which he loved and he built his sanctuary like the heights like the earth which he hath founded for ever he chose david also his servant and took him from the sheepfolds from following the ewes that give suck he brought him to be shepherd over jacob his people and israel his inheritance so he shepherded them according to the integrity of his heart and lead them by the skilfulness of his hands  a psalm of asaph no god the heathen are come into thine inheritance they have defiled thy holy temple nthey have made jerusalem into heaps they have given the

oath unto isaac and he established it unto jacob for a statute to israel for an everlasting covenant saying unto thee will i give the land of canaan the lot of your inheritance when they were but a few men in number yea very few and sojourners in it and when they went about from nation to nation from one kingdom to another people he suffered no man to do them wrong yea for their sake he reproved kings touch not mine anointed ones and do my prophets no harm and he called a famine upon the land he broke the whole staff of bread he sent a man before them joseph was sold for a servant his feet they hurt with fetters his person was laid in iron until the time that his word came to pass the word of the lord tested him the king sent and loosed him even the ruler of the peoples and set him free he made him lord of his house and ruler of all his possessions to bind his princes at his pleasure and teach his elders wisdom israel also came into egypt and jacob sojourned in the land of ham and he increased his people greatly and made them too mighty for their adversaries he turned their heart to hate his people to deal craftily with his servants he sent moses his servant and aaron whom he had chosen they wrought among them his manifold signs and wonders in the land of ham he sent darkness and it was dark and they rebelled not against his word he turned their waters into blood and slew their fish their land swarmed with frogs in the chambers of their kings he spoke and there came swarms of flies and gnats in all their borders he gave them hail for rain and flaming fire in their land he smote their vines also and their figtrees and broke the trees of their borders he spoke and the locust came and the cankerworm without number and did eat up every herb in their land and did eat up the fruit of their ground he smote also all the firstborn in their land the firstfruits of all their strength and he brought them forth with silver and gold and there was none that stumbled among his tribes egypt was glad when they departed for the fear of them had fallen upon them he spread a cloud for a screen and fire to give light in the night they asked and he brought quails and gave them in plenty the bread of heaven he opened the rock and waters gushed out they ran a river in the dry places for he remembered his holy word unto abraham his servant and he brought forth his people with joy

thy nation nthat i may glory with thine inheritance we have sinned with our fathers we have done iniquitously we have dealt wickedly our fathers in egypt gave no heed unto thy wonders nthey remembered not the multitude of thy mercies nbut were rebellious at the sea even at the red sea nevertheless he saved them for his names sake that he might make his mighty power to be known and he rebuked the red sea and it was dried up and he led them through the depths as through a wilderness and he saved them from the hand of him that hated them and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy and the waters covered their adversaries there was not one of them left then believed they his words they sang his praise they soon forgot his works they waited not for his counsel but lusted exceedingly in the wilderness and tried god in the desert and he gave them their request but sent leanness into their soul they were jealous also of moses in the camp and of aaron the holy one of the lord the earth opened and swallowed up dathan and covered the company of abiram and a fire was kindled in their company the flame burned up the wicked they made a calf in horeb and worshipped a molten image thus they exchanged their glory for the likeness of an ox that eateth grass they forgot god their saviour who had done great things in egypt wondrous works in the land of ham terrible things by the red sea therefore he said that he would destroy them nhad not moses his chosen stood before him in the breach nto turn back his wrath lest he should destroy them moreover they scorned the desirable land they believed not his word and they murmured in their tents they hearkened not unto the voice of the lord therefore he swore concerning them that he would overthrow them in the wilderness and that he would cast out their seed among the nations and scatter them in the lands they joined themselves also unto baal of peor and ate the sacrifices of the dead thus they provoked him with their doings and the plague broke in upon them then stood up phinehas and wrought judgment and so the plague was stayed and that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all generations for ever they angered him also at the waters of meribah and it went ill with moses because of them for they embittered his spirit and he spoke rashly with his lips they did not destroy the peoples as the lord commanded them but mingled themselves with the nations and learned their works and they served their idols which became a snare unto them yea they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto demons and shed innocent blood even the blood of their sons and of their daughters whom they sacrificed unto the idols of canaan nand the land was polluted with blood thus were they defiled with their works and went astray in their doings therefore was the wrath of the lord kindled against his people and he abhorred his inheritance and he gave them into the hand of the nations and they that hated them ruled over them their enemies also oppressed them and they were subdued under their hand many times did he deliver them nbut they were rebellious in their counsel and sank low through their iniquity nevertheless he looked upon their distress when he heard their cry and he remembered for them his covenant and repented according to the multitude of his mercies he made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them
